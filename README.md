## Comparing bias
https://www.adfontesmedia.com/interactive-media-bias-chart/ - the first google hit is a media company. Weird? But they list AP and Reuters as the most reliable with least bias. They list The New York times as skews left, and InfoWars as Hyper-Partisan Right. The Hill comes up in the center, somewhat surprisingly. Fox News on the right is the equivalent of MSNBC on the left
https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-chart - they smartly split the opinion sections from the online news orgs. They have NPR, Reuters, and Ap as the center
https://sharylattkisson.com/2019/04/media-bias-chart-analysis/ - Sharyl Attkisson says the APO is to the left as much as Fox News is to the right. Meanwhile she labels The New York Times as far left along with NPR, with InfoWars as mid-right. She labels Snopes as mid left. Her commenters say things like "I view InfoWars as further left." Amazing. I'd label this as unreliable.
