(For those not hip enough for “Star Trek” references: The order used to be “tea, Earl Grey, hot.”) The new show finds Picard — the erstwhile commander of the famous fictional starship known as the Enterprise — in reflective form, grappling with the past as an aged version of himself. It has a starry showrunner in the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Chabon, who will presumably bring a new kind of energy to the franchise. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Stewart said he was drawn to the new story because it explored “the profound psychological differences in the character, who felt abandoned, distrusted and unnecessary.” Stewart asked, “Where is he now? What matters to him? What control does he have over his life? Very little, as it turned out.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
