The filmmaker Tom McCarthy’s 2015 investigative journalism nail-biter, “Spotlight,” won an Academy Award for best picture. “Timmy Failure,” his first movie since, is also about professional investigators. One of them is an 11-year-old. The other is a polar bear.

While the movie is skipping theaters in favor of being released directly on Disney’s streaming service, “it owes more to independent cinema than anything,” McCarthy told The New York Times last year. It is both family-oriented and proudly weird.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
