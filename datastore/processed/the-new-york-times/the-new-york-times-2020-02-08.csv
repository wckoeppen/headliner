Alison Brie — who co-wrote this film with its director, Jeff Baena — plays Sarah, an unassuming and socially awkward arts-and-crafts store employee who doesn’t quite fit in with her Zumba classmates or her roommate. Despite this, she finds comfort in her favorite TV show, “Purgatory,” and in visiting a horse she used to own — both of which seem to protect her from the world’s harsh realities, including her mother’s death and her grandmother’s psychosis. Then, Sarah begins to spiral. In what is a clear mental health decline, Sarah finds herself entangled in a web of amnesia, hallucinations and supernatural experiences. “It would be tactful, at this point, for ‘Horse Girl’ to show how Sarah’s hallucinations are causing her suffering; instead, it indulges them,” Natalia Winkelman wrote in her review for The New York Times.
