The Met has never before presented an exhibition of art from the West Indies, and it concentrates here on the ritual objects — thrones, vessels and mysterious bird-shaped stones — of the Taíno people, who inhabited the islands now called Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Cuba and Turks and Caicos. On these islands, and on the Caribbean-facing coasts of Central America, styles mingled and migrated, and art had both religious and diplomatic functions; one extravagant gold pendant here, in the shape of a bird with splayed wings and zigzagging necklaces, traveled from Panama all the way to the Antilles. As the Met begins renovations of its Rockefeller Wing, the Caribbean offers its curators a priceless model of how to think about world cultures: never “pure” but in constant motion and constant contact, diffracted across time and oceans.

Based on a young adult novel by Jenny Han and heavily inspired by teenage comedies of the 1980s, the movie became a streaming hit when it debuted in 2018. The sequel continues the story of the teenagers Lara Jean (played by Lana Condor) and Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo), whose happily-ever-after ends up being complicated by the fact that, well, they’re in high school, and they’re human. “When dealing with a franchise, especially one that was as successful as the first film, you really want to follow up with something that isn’t just exactly what the audience would want,” Centineo said in a recent interview with The New York Times.
