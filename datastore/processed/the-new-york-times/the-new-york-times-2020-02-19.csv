In time, I would acquaint myself with the Civil War-era sisters growing up in genteel poverty in Louisa May Alcott’s 1868-69 “Little Women” (after Beth dies, there are three); and after that, the many geometries of women, sisters and friends, as well as meddling aunts and ineffectual mothers, in the 19th-century novels of Jane Austen.
