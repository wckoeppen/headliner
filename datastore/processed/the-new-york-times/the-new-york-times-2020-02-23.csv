The speech, barely more than 700 words, is now considered one of the most important in American history. But on the day it was delivered, March 4, 1865, with the Union on the brink of victory in the Civil War, Lincoln had trouble placating his own party, much less his political opponents. And he opted to write words that addressed slavery in grand, religious terms, rather than itemizing the practical ways in which the country would have to begin moving forward. In “Every Drop of Blood,” Edward Achorn addresses sweeping issues about the war and the precarious state of the nation by narrowing his lens to the 24 hours around the inauguration and the many notable characters around the president that day. Below, Achorn discusses the hostility toward the president, the diaries of Southern women, how Stanley Kubrick is like Lincoln and more.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

When M. Millerand, who returned to London this evening, resumes his part in conference to-morrow, he will face an agreement between Great Britain, Italy and Japan to recognise the Soviet Government.

Often the pair achieves this sort of tension by balancing the conceptual with the casual. It’s no surprise, then, that when they did decide to collaborate, it was with Birkenstock, the nearly 250-year-old German shoe company whose legions of fans include many a fashion person, perhaps because the iconic chunky sandals can always be relied upon to offset a look that threatens to come off as too dressed.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
