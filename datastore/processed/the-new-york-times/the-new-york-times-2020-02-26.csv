The new big-screen adaptation of Jack London’s “The Call of the Wild” shares an actor with “War for the Planet of the Apes,” but you won’t see his face in either movie: He’s Terry Notary, a motion-capture performer whose movements provided the basis for the digital dog that stars opposite Harrison Ford in “The Call of the Wild,” and who played one of Andy Serkis’s chimpanzee companions in the “Planet of the Apes” movies of the 2010s. “War for the Planet of the Apes,” the most recent one of those, completes the story of Caesar, the chimpanzee revolutionary played by Serkis. It hinges on a rivalry between Caesar and an angry human colonel played by Woody Harrelson. (Caesar spends much of the series proving that he has more humanity than the humans in it, who want to wipe out his species.) “The motion-captured, digitally sculpted apes are so natural, so expressive, so beautifully integrated into their environment, that you almost forget to be astonished by the nuances of thought and emotion that flicker across their faces, often seen in close-up,” A.O.
