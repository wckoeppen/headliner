Throughout the fashion world, men’s tailoring is anything but stuffy or staid these days, despite its sometimes conservative reputation. In checks and tartans, it can be punk; with soft, boxy silhouettes, it can be easy; and — paired with transparent blouses, ruffle details and velvet trim — it can subvert gender lines.

Site of the first commercial bungee-jumping operation — established in 1988 over the Kawarau River — Queenstown is the place to test your courage by jumping off, flying over or skimming above things. During the winter (June through September), visitors flock to four ski areas in the surrounding Southern Alps. The rest of the year, Queenstown serves as the gateway to Mount Aspiring National Park, Fiordland National Park in the west, and countless hikes, including multiday treks on the Milford, Routeburn Greenstone and Caples tracks. In March, the beginning of fall, the crowds have eased but the weather is still great for outdoor adventures. The Akarua Arrowtown Autumn Festival in nearby Arrowtown is from April 16 to 20, and the LUMA Southern Light Project, which brings light installations to Queenstown Gardens, takes place May 29 to June 1. On the shores of glacially carved Lake Wakatipu, New Zealand’s third largest lake, Queenstown offers a respite from the wild with sophisticated dining and shopping, each with a distinct Kiwi accent.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

Helping her are a best friend (played by Sofia Bryant) and an eccentric young neighbor (Wyatt Oleff). The series “is firmly within both the superhero and teen-angst traditions,” James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The New York Times, “and, fair warning, is not immune to the clichés of either.
