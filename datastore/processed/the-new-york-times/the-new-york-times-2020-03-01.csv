Fans of elaborate scavenger hunts would get a kick of out this new anthology series. The idea came to Jason Segel, the show’s creator and star, after he discovered an art project and immersive game that drew more than 7,000 people in San Francisco and Oakland from 2008 to 2011.

There’s an element of growth here: Along the way, the journey helps participants overcome inner battles. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Segel said the show celebrates regular people. “A lot of stories are about someone finding out that they’re extraordinary,” he said. “And this whole thing, it’s this idea that we can all be ordinary together and that it’s beautiful.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
