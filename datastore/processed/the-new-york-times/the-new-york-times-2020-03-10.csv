In 1981, the city center was even named a Unesco World Heritage Site on account of its Roman and Romanesque monuments. Among them is the Roman Catholic Church of St. Trophime, which was built between the 12th and 15th centuries, and the Arles Amphitheater, where, in medieval times, gladiators and charioteers entertained tens of thousands of spectators at a time. The Amphitheater, along with the nearby first-century Théâtre Antique, proved fitting locations for T’s latest digital cover shoot, which was photographed by Pieter Hugo and styled by Jay Massacret. The looks feature billowing black and white dresses and separates with nipped-in waists and ecclesiastical touches like high collars and lace. On their feet the models wore gladiator-style sandals — another nod to the last millennium.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

Unrivaled in timing precision (to one-tenth of a second) with a barrel-shaped tonneau case displaying a round dial with three charcoal-tinted subdials, the El Primero was considered a mechanical marvel; its chronograph module used an entirely integrated caliber, not just one bolted to an existing automatic movement. But the El Primero wasn’t on top for long: Just a few years later, quartz — an element that enabled watches to tell time even more accurately — threatened to make mechanical watches obsolete. Luckily, Zenith’s chronograph, along with the company, was saved when, in 1988, Rolex used the elegantly slender, self-winding caliber to power an updated version of its classic Daytona, which turned the movement into a cult favorite. Fifty years after El Primero’s debut, the company has released a timepiece that pays homage to the original 1969 model. Just two small tweaks were needed to bring it into the present: The hollow links of the original bracelet designed by the renowned Geneva firm Gay Frères have been rendered in solid steel; and there’s now a sapphire crystal caseback, the better to fixate endlessly on a timepiece that helped fine horology take a leap into the future. $8,200, zenith-watches.com.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
