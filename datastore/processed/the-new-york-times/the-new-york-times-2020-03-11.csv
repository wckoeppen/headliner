So he has now become a hammelier and opened his own spot, a sliver of brick walls and mirrors with just 20 seats in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, where he lives with his wife, Phoebe Damrosch, a writer and a partner in the restaurant, and their four sons. They have at least 11 American cured heritage-breed hams on the menu. Some are from venerable producers that have been curing hams for 100 years or more, and others are the work of newcomers. Many of the hams are from Kentucky, and some, like the ruddy Dakota, are on a more-or-less exclusive basis. The chef Cesare Casella’s prosciutto from upstate New York also gets its turn on the vintage slicer. Cornmeal madeleines and American cheeses are served, and Mr. Mack limits his wines to American selections. “I have about 320 labels, many from vintages going back to the 1970s and ’80s,” he said. He grew up in Texas, and began his wine career at the French Laundry. He went on to work at Per Se, and left to start making his own wine, which he still does, with Maison Noir Wines, in Oregon. He also runs a wine shop, VyneYard, nearby. In a few months, he plans a retail shop, & Sons Buttery, selling hams, cheeses, condiments and table accessories, next door to the restaurant.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

So he has now become a hammelier and opened his own spot, a sliver of brick walls and mirrors with just 20 seats in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, where he lives with his wife, Phoebe Damrosch, a writer and a partner in the restaurant, and their four sons. They have at least 11 American cured heritage-breed hams on the menu. Some are from venerable producers that have been curing hams for 100 years or more, and others are the work of newcomers. Many of the hams are from Kentucky, and some, like the ruddy Dakota, are on a more-or-less exclusive basis. The chef Cesare Casella’s prosciutto from upstate New York also gets its turn on the vintage slicer. Cornmeal madeleines and American cheeses are served, and Mr. Mack limits his wines to American selections. “I have about 320 labels, many from vintages going back to the 1970s and ’80s,” he said. He grew up in Texas, and began his wine career at the French Laundry. He went on to work at Per Se, and left to start making his own wine, which he still does, with Maison Noir Wines, in Oregon. He also runs a wine shop, VyneYard, nearby. In a few months, he plans a retail shop, & Sons Buttery, selling hams, cheeses, condiments and table accessories, next door to the restaurant.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
