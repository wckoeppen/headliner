While later she became known for her realistic depictions of flowers and animals, especially the house’s now iconic panther (her nick­name was La Panthère), in the early years, she explored geometric form and unusual gems. Among them was the rare pinkish-orange imperial topaz, mined in the 19th century in western Russia’s Ural Mountains, when only the czar’s family were allowed to wear the stones. This new necklace features three exquisite imperial topazes from Brazil, including a dangling 11-carat pear-cut bicolor stone with an ombré effect that shifts from fuchsia to Tuscan yellow.

While later she became known for her realistic depictions of flowers and animals, especially the house’s now iconic panther (her nick­name was La Panthère), in the early years, she explored geometric form and unusual gems.
