Set three years after 2017’s “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” a reboot of the 1995 movie, this adventure film brings back the core gang — Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and Jack Black — along with a few new faces. As the friends plan to reunite during winter break, one, Spencer, delves back into the Jumanji video game, and the rest of the group has no choice but to follow him. But the game malfunctions, leaving Bethany, another of the friends, in the real world and dragging in Spencer’s grandfather (Danny DeVito) and his old friend (Danny Glover). What’s more, the youngsters don’t have the same avatars as before — which makes for some amusing and not-so-amusing performances. (Hart channeling Glover? Sure. Johnson playing DeVito? Not quite.) Critics said the movie doesn’t live up to “Welcome to the Jungle,” but carries enough laughs and tantalizing action scenes to keep you in the game.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

College-educated adults usually read between 200 and 400 words per minute (a comfortable listening rate is around 150 words per minute). The speediest speed readers claim as many as 30,000 words per minute, at which point research would suggest a significant loss of comprehension. It might be fine to skim through a user manual for an office printer, but don’t skim “Anna Karenina” and expect to understand it. “In this modern age, we always want to do everything faster,” says Schotter, whose lab uses high-speed video to analyze readers’ eyes as they dart across text. America’s speed-reading obsession confounds Schotter; on average, people read twice as fast as they can comfortably listen. Reading is visually and cognitively complicated; it’s OK to reread a line because it’s confusing or, better yet, to linger on a phrase so beautiful that it makes you want to close your eyes.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

Set three years after 2017’s “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” a reboot of the 1995 movie, this adventure film brings back the core gang — Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and Jack Black — along with a few new faces. As the friends plan to reunite during winter break, one, Spencer, delves back into the Jumanji video game, and the rest of the group has no choice but to follow him. But the game malfunctions, leaving Bethany, another of the friends, in the real world and dragging in Spencer’s grandfather (Danny DeVito) and his old friend (Danny Glover). What’s more, the youngsters don’t have the same avatars as before — which makes for some amusing and not-so-amusing performances. (Hart channeling Glover? Sure. Johnson playing DeVito? Not quite.) Critics said the movie doesn’t live up to “Welcome to the Jungle,” but carries enough laughs and tantalizing action scenes to keep you in the game.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

In 2005, Gordon moved to London to study women’s wear at Central Saint Martins, spending two summers interning with Oscar de la Renta in New York (“I showed up for my interview looking like an extra from ‘Brideshead Revisited’”) before working part-time at Tom Ford’s London atelier in Chelsea. Upon graduating in 2009, he moved to Manhattan for good and launched his namesake collection from his studio apartment, where he slept on an air mattress. Despite its scrappy start, Gordon’s elegant line — full of youthful cocktail dresses, suits and jumpsuits in vibrant, happy hues — was soon picked up by Saks Fifth Avenue and Harrods, and later worn by everyone from Lena Dunham to Michelle Obama.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
