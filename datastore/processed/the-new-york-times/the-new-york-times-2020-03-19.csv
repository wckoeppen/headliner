Pete Davidson plays a role model with platinum blond hair and a taste for weed in this coarse coming-of-age comedy, the debut film of the writer-director Jason Orley. The plot centers on a brotherly relationship between Davidson’s character, a 23-year-old named Zeke, and Mo (Griffin Gluck), his ex-girlfriend’s 16-year-old younger brother, whom he walks through the finer points of the suburban slacker lifestyle. The story also involves small-time drug dealing and Mo’s pursuit of a crush (played by Oona Laurence). “Though Davidson, Gluck and Laurence show star potential, Orley either boxes them into a too-conventional coming-of-age arc or gives them cloyingly charming characteristics,” Kristen Yoonsoo Kim wrote in her review for The New York Times. “Despite some moments of tenderness and easy chemistry between Zeke and Mo,” Kim added, “‘Big Time Adolescence’ doesn’t have enough heart or humor to save it from becoming just another movie about white dudes bro-ing out.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
