Born Sarah Breedlove, Walker started her journey as a sales person for a black hair care entrepreneur before breaking away to make her own products. She started out by selling them door-to-door and eventually grew her brand into an empire. Loosely based on the book “On Her Own Ground,” by Walker’s great-great-granddaughter A’Lelia Bundles, the show mostly concerns her later years and charts her obstacles with racial and gender biases.
