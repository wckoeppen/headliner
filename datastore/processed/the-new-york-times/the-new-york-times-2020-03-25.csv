Directed by Jim LeBrecht and Nicole Newnham, the film begins by focusing on Camp Jened, which was founded in the early 1950s and served as a community for campers with disabilities. But it eventually shifts focus to look at the adult lives of some of the camp’s alumni, several of whom became prominent activists. In his review for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that the film “unfolds from a perspective of lived experience.” Newnham and LeBrecht, he added, “deftly juggle a large cast of characters past and present, accomplishing the not-so-easy task of making all the personalities distinct.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
