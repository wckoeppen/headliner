Marianne (Noémie Merlant), an artist in 18th-century France, is commissioned to paint a portrait of Héloïse (Adèle Haenel), a lonely noblewoman who is soon to be married off. The portrait is a gift for Héloïse’s future husband, but she is dreading the wedding and refuses to sit for the painting. So her mother hires Marianne as a companion and asks her to create the artwork in secret after observing Héloïse’s every move. Her looks don’t go unnoticed. The more time Héloïse and Marianne spend alone, the deeper they fall into a passionate affair. The main draw here is the romance, but the movie is also a tale of sisterhood: an examination of women breaking free from the shackles of tradition, class and patriarchy.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
