Set around America’s 2003 invasion of Iraq, “Baghdad Central” stars Waleed Zuaiter as Muhsin Al-Khafaji, a former law enforcement operative whose mission requires him to form an uneasy partnership with U.S. forces. (“I’m never sure if they’re going to shoot me in the head,” he says early on.) The series, based on a novel by the scholar Elliott Colla, originally aired on the British network Channel 4 and was generally well-received. “It’s nice to see an Iraq war-set thriller that centers on Iraqi lives for a change,” Ellen E. Jones wrote in a review for The Guardian. “Nice because it’s the right thing for a socially conscious broadcaster to commission, but also just nice because it makes for some refreshingly original entertainment.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
