Logan Rodriguez, the restaurant’s beverage director, uses Collective Arts Rhubarb & Hibiscus Gin. There are other rhubarb gins out there, and absent the rhubarb flavor, other floral gins, especially pink gins, would work. For one drink, you need two ounces of the gin in a mixing glass, along with a half-ounce each of Campari, Pineau des Charentes or white Lillet, and grapefruit liqueur, plus two dashes of Peychaud’s bitters. Stir well with ice, then strain into a double rocks glass with fresh ice. You can garnish with a strip of citrus peel or, as I have done, a stirrer cut from a stalk of rhubarb.

Malcolm grew up in a home that celebrated black pride, boldly proclaimed black dignity, and brandished political activism as practically a familial birthright. The members of the Little family were pioneer black nationalists who endeavored to follow Garvey’s dictum of establishing black political power across urban and rural American landscapes. Garvey tapped into deep currents of black political radicalism swirling in a newly reconfigured urban American landscape, one populated by black southern migrants and Caribbean immigrants. The Great Migration, which started between the world wars and crested in the immediate years after blacks won the right to vote, dispersed millions of southern migrants across the nation’s vast expanse, in the process creating archipelagoes of black cultural and political power in small and large cities. Inspired by the bootstrap racial uplift politics of Booker T. Washington and intrigued by anti-colonial rhetoric, Garvey promoted a philosophy of black nationalism that he offered, like Promethean fire, to any black person courageous enough to take it.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
