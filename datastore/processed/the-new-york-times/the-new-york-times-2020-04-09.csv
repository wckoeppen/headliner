The movie follows Autumn (Sidney Flanigan), a 17-year-old who can’t get an abortion in her central Pennsylvania hometown without parental permission, which isn’t in the cards for her. So she takes a bus to New York, where she can have the procedure without permission. But the city presents its own host of challenges. Manohla Dargis called the movie a “low-key knockout” in her review for The Times. “Hittman is telling a story,” Dargis added, “but she’s also making a quietly fierce argument about female sovereignty.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
