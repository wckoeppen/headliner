But instead of making cranes or flowers, she preferred to transform the sheets of printed paper into utilitarian objects, like boxes. “There was something about the ingenuity of a flat object being folded up to be 3-D in order to hold something,” says Ping, 41. One day, inspired by Angus MacGyver, the resourceful secret agent and titular character of the 1980s television series — “He was always finding solutions with little more than chewing gum and a toothpick,” says Ping — she folded a paper tea set for her dolls. “My mom was so annoyed,” she says of the water-soaked mess that ensued. Another creation that stands out in Ping’s mind is a paper boat she made, and that her father, who’d trained as a mechanical engineer, improved upon with side panels made from leftover paper — suddenly, the ordinary canoe was a catamaran. “It even had a canopy,” Ping recalls. “I was like, Oh my god.

And none can measure up to pommes purées, the legacy of the chef Joël Robuchon, who died in 2018. They’re served at L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon in New York (and elsewhere around the world), but the restaurant is closed for the pandemic so you will just have to make them at home. To serve four generously (because they are very rich), boil a pound of unpeeled Yukon Gold potatoes until tender, drain, then peel and mash them using a ricer. Return them to the pot and heat them gently for a few seconds, then add half a pound of unsalted butter, bit by bit, mixing vigorously the whole time. Slowly mix in about four tablespoons of warm whole milk. Season with salt and pepper, give them a few turns with a whisk to lighten them and serve. They can be kept warm in the top of a double boiler. ",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
