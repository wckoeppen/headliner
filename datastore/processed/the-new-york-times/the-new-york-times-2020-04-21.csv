The past year has not been easy on “Empire,” a drama about the family of a hip-hop mogul (Terrence Howard). Before the sixth and final season debuted last fall, the writers wrote off one of the main characters, played by Jussie Smollett, who is being investigated for potentially staging a hate crime he himself reported. Now, the series is ending earlier than planned because production shut down before the final two episodes could be completed. This episode will have to tie up a few loose ends: While Bossyfest opens, Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) tries to regain control of Empire. Lucious (Howard) contemplates his feelings for her while still supporting Yana (Kiandra Richardson). And, since flashbacks from earlier episodes showed grim endings for Cookie and Lucious, it’s clear the Lyon family is still in hot water.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

She was sitting on the white sheets of an unmade hotel bed and looking straight at the camera, her knees tucked underneath her. The school bus driver thought his wife looked odd in these vacation pictures. She’d never posed this way before, for him. Her black hair was set in big soft curls and she looked like a child’s doll: blue eyelids, long artificial eyelashes, round rosy cheeks, red lips. She would never, on her own, make herself up like this. This bikini would never be something she’d choose for herself. “Hee keyow,” she would say, shaking her head in disapproval if he ever suggested she wear anything even slightly revealing.

The Tower was just a room over the garage in the eighteenth-century New England farmhouse where she and my grandfather had lived and raised three children during the 1950s and where they still spent weekends, holidays, and long stretches of summer. I’m not sure who christened it “the Tower,” but the name was used ironically by both her and the rest of the family, an acknowledgment of the privilege of solitude and time. The manuscripts I was poking about in were housed in repurposed ream boxes with words like “Eaton” and “Corrasable Bond” on the sides, and in black three-ring binders whose leather casings were beginning to crack. There were dozens of boxes and binders, including ones with A Wrinkle in Time, The Arm of the Starfish, and A Wind in the Door written on them, but I wasn’t interested in the manuscripts of stories that could be read as real books: I was more curious about the scraps and stories and studies in the other boxes. I came across “Gilberte Must Play Bach” in one of those. I’m not sure why I stopped to read this particular one, but I liked the French name in the title, and the imperative. The story was strange to me, and sad, and although the girl in the story was named Claudine, I understood it to be autobiographical. The sadness of the story—and its unresolvedness—shook me and gave me a glimpse at the depth of things we might discover about the people we love.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
