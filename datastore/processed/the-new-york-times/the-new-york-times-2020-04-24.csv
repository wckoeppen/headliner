The two surviving members of the Beastie Boys, Adam Horovitz and Michael Diamond, walk an audience through their band’s history in this unconventional documentary. Think of it like a Beastie Boys TED talk: Directed by Spike Jonze, the film shows the present-day Horovitz and Diamond onstage, telling their story as archival footage and video is projected behind them. (The documentary is an adaptation of a stage show Horovitz and Diamond hosted in 2019.) The setup allows for some entertainingly peculiar moments, as when the elder Horovitz interrupts footage of the band’s early shows, where his younger self is reading rap lyrics off a crumpled piece of paper. Turning from the projected video to the audience with apparent embarrassment, Horovitz asks, “Most rappers hold their rhymes in little pieces of paper, right?”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
