Their search plays out while the city is building its freeway system and displacing Chicano families in the process. A shape-shifting demon inspired by Mexican folklore (played by Natalie Dormer of “Game of Thrones”) somehow ties into all of this, while subplots involving Nazi insurgents and police brutality bring the series, or at least its themes, to the present. “Even though our show is set in 1938, it has to be about 2020 or it has no reason to exist,” Logan said in a recent interview with The New York Times. “Race relations, social engineering, politics, espionage — all of that was bubbling away exactly the way it’s bubbling away now.” The series finale of HOMELAND leads in at 9 p.m.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
