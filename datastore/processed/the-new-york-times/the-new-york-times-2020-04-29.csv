In one of their first scenes together, Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and Connell (Paul Mescal), the Irish teenagers at the center of this series, have a conversation about that most weighty of adolescent subjects: their school grades. “You’re smarter than me,” Connell says. Marianne’s reply comes quickly, in a matter-of-fact tone: “Smarter than everyone,” she says.

Their bond highlights issues of social class, as the pair — one wealthy, one poor — move from secondary school to university.
