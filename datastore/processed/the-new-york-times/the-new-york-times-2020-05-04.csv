Since graduating from the prestigious fashion program at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp in 2005, Rogge, now 36, has checked off two of the three. After university, she moved to New York and worked with Jacobs for seven years, first as an intern and eventually as one of the lead women’s wear designers, before relocating to Antwerp and heading women’s wear design at Van Noten’s eponymous brand for three years. In 2019, when the time came to make her next move, rather than try for a hat trick, Rogge instead decided to found her own namesake label — not in Milan or New York or Antwerp but in a 19th-century Flemish barn nine miles southwest of Ghent.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
