Until now, the films produced by Michelle and Barack Obama’s entertainment company, Higher Ground Productions, have not been about either of the Obamas themselves. “American Factory” (2019) looked at what happened after a closed General Motors factory in Ohio was taken over by a Chinese company, while the more recent “Crip Camp” centered on disability rights activism. But Michelle Obama steps in front of the lens in “Becoming,” a documentary from the Obamas’ company that revolves around the former first lady and her memoir of the same name. The film follows Obama on a nationwide tour to promote the memoir. Directed by Nadia Hallgren, a documentary filmmaker from the Bronx, the film has been advertised less as an adaptation of the book and more of a companion piece looking at Obama’s life after leaving the White House. “So little of who I am happened in those eight years,” she says in a trailer. “So much more of who I was happened before.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

But disgorging one? Yes, try this at home. Just follow the step-by-step that comes with Família Geisse’s Cave Amadeu Rústico Nature from southern Brazil. In sparkling wine parlance, disgorging refers to extracting the sediment, or lees, that accumulate as the wine develops. Traditionally it’s done by gradually turning the bottle upside down in a special rack, a technique called riddling. Once upended, the sediment falls into the neck of the bottle, which is then briefly frozen so when the cap is removed the frozen plug of sediment is expelled by the carbonation of the wine; the bottle is then corked. And you do not have to be in Mme. Pommery’s chalky cellar in Reims to do it. At home you leave the bottle nearly upside down for a week, then freeze it for 90 minutes, pop off the metal cap and the sediment shoots out. Mine was perfect. It’s best done outside or maybe over a bathtub. The disgorged wine is light, fizzy and pleasant. I also tried a bottle of the wine without disgorging, making it what’s called a pét-nat these days. It was cloudy but with more complexity on the palate. Disgorging is worth trying at least once, and understanding what lees contribute to the wine made it doubly worthwhile.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
