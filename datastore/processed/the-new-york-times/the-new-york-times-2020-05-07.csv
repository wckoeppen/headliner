In the second entry of Daniel Alfredson’s thematic “Intrigo” trilogy, from a book by the Swedish author Hakan Nesser, the friends refer to this Hitchcock movie while hatching their own plan, inviting not only an unfair cinematic comparison to a masterpiece, but also scrutiny over a simple but flawed plot.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
