This documentary takes viewers inside Biosphere 2 (known as No. 2 because Biosphere 1 is the Earth), an experimental research facility that was built by a Texas oil tycoon to prove that humans could remain healthy while quarantining in a bubble. Built in Oracle, Ariz., with its own mini-rainforest, desert and ocean with a living coral reef, the idyllic bubble was meant to prepare scientists for space colonization. But in 1991, when the first eight scientists sealed themselves inside the terrarium-like habitat for the two-year experiment, things went awry. Directed by Matt Wolf (“Teenage”), this film looks at the odd and dark twists that took place in the utopian biosphere.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
