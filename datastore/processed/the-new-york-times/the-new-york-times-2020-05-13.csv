A sober answer to the era’s flashy It-bags, its clean lines and functional design quickly made it a favorite among customers searching for a versatile accessory with a more timeless, cerebral feel. (Its cinematic appeal was further solidified in 2015, when the brand commissioned the American director and photographer Autumn de Wilde to create a series of surreal short films, later reprised in 2017, inspired by the bag.) As Prada prepares to enter a new era — in which Raf Simons will join Miuccia Prada as the company’s co-creative director — the Galleria will remain, its ongoing popularity a testament to the brand’s heritage. And, with many of Italy’s manufacturing businesses now operating once again and shops poised to reopen after being hard hit by the global pandemic, the leather artisans who create each iteration of the bag have recently been able to resume their craft.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

The suggestion that Shakespeare wrote “King Lear” during plague lockdown has been widely circulated recently (online, at least), and some ambitious souls may be inspired to take advantage of social distancing to try to write the next great play, novel or TV pilot. For the rest of us, catching up on movies will have to suffice. One option, for those who missed it, is this revisionist take on “Hamlet.” As the title suggests, the movie takes the characters and plot of that Shakespeare play but gives them its own spin: It focuses on Ophelia (Daisy Ridley), the lover of Hamlet (George MacKay), who gets her own story line here as the action of the play takes a back seat. Directed by Claire McCarthy and based on a young adult novel by Lisa Klein, the movie makes for an “interesting exercise and, for the most part, a passably diverting one,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. This, Dargis added, is “Ophelia as a 21st-century heroine, who after a smudge-faced childhood running wild in her king’s castle — and being excluded from studying with the boys — grows into a woman with desires, ambitions and a pronounced rebellious streak.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
