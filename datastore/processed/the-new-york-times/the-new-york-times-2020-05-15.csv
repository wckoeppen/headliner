They tend to hold the book’s central mismatched-but-also-kind-of-perfect-together couple, Marianne and Connell, close to their hearts. So adapting the book for TV came with risks. “It was a big leap of faith,” Rooney told The Hollywood Reporter earlier this year about casting the show, “that we were going to find people who would just get it, and would know exactly how to communicate that friction between the inner life and the outer world.” Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal have received widespread acclaim for their performances in the 12-part series on Hulu. Some of the praise for the show came from James Poniewozik, The Times’s chief television critic, who called it a “gorgeous, melancholy series” starring leads who “have so much chemistry you may need lab goggles.” Poniewozik recently joined The Times’s three book critics — Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai — for a discussion I moderated about the show, the novel, the art of adaptation and more. — John Williams, Daily Books Editor",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
