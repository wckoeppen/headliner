I think today’s construction is an escalation in the unthemed Sunday crossword monster construction race, as it has only 122 entries, tied with a beast from last year by Frank Longo (fewer answers make puzzles tougher to solve and absolute bears to build, as a rule). As its title intimates, this grid also has 177 “open squares,” which are empty squares that don’t touch any black block, even diagonally, third only to a 218 Patrick Berry Sunday puzzle and the aforementioned Longo puzzle. Joel Fagliano has made a 124-answer Sunday puzzle in the last year as well; all of these have been unthemed. Perhaps one day we’ll get a collaboration between all of these constructors with 42 spans and no black squares at all, and someone will still drop a “too easy!” in the comments.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
