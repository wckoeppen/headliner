By Sara Aridi,What’s on TV Sunday: ‘Lance’ and ‘Underestimate the Girl’,"Watch a celebrity profile or two: A portrait of Lance Armstrong airs on ESPN, while a documentary about Kate Nash is available to rent.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday-lance-and-underestimate-the-girl.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/arts/24tvcol-lance/24tvcol-lance-articleLarge.jpg,2020-05-24T05:00:06+0000,"30 FOR 30: LANCE 9 p.m. on ESPN. Nearly eight years after an investigation by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency found that Lance Armstrong had been using performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career — making him a pariah essentially overnight — the disgraced athlete has resurfaced to reflect on his misdeeds. This two-part documentary by the director Marina Zenovich (“Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind”), airing as part of ESPN’s “30 for 30” series, gives him ample opportunity to do so. (Although if you’ve already made up your mind on Armstrong, the former superstar cyclist, this movie might not change it.) The film packs plenty of back story, chronicling his early days as a cyclist, his battle with testicular cancer and the demise of his reputation after he admitted to doping in 2013. Zenovich doesn’t shy away from tough questions, and by interviewing Armstrong’s family, friends, rivals and others, she manages to create an objective portrait of a shunned star. The second half of the film airs May 31.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

When he asked whether I suffered blackouts or short-term memory loss after a handful of head-ringing encounters with improvised explosive devices, I again said no. Still, he recommended me for disability. The reason: hearing loss. I had passed my audiogram but, according to the doctor, that didn’t matter.
