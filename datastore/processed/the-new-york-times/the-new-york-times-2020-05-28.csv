In his 2018 historical drama, “Jeannette: The Childhood of Joan of Arc,” the French director Bruno Dumont infused Saint Joan’s formative years with a sonic landscape that featured prominent, raucous guitar shredding. For his follow-up, “Joan of Arc,” Dumont focuses on Joan of Arc’s later years, this time using electronic pop music to help tell the story. The film casts one of the performers who played Joan in Dumont’s earlier movie, Lise Leplat Prudhomme, opposite the French pop singer Christophe, who plays one of the priests who try Joan. “Here and in the earlier picture it’s perhaps easy to apprehend Dumont’s approach with a ‘What’s this oddball up to now?’ smirk,” Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times. “But if Dumont is joking at all, it’s a form of what used to be called ‘kidding on the square.’”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
