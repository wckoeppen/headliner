Thinking it was stolen, she began to sob. Her teacher asked her: “Pourquoi as-tu tant de peine pour un crayon?” (Why so much grief over a pencil?) His question has remained with Davey, the New York-based artist, for 50 years. The anecdote — the triviality of the pencil, the pinprick of a particular line — is emblematic of her art, in which tension comes from small traumas and everyday talismans. Moving between video, photography and prose, Davey’s work is bound by idiosyncratic references and quasi-dreamed connections. An acute chronicler of quotidian life, she is both the narrator and protagonist of her work. She paces her apartment hallways in her videos; she photographs the dust under her bed; she reads and writes restlessly, hoping to find what Walter Benjamin called the “tiny spark of accident” that will set off stray thoughts and images. “Index Cards,” which she wrote between 2003 to 2019, reads like a serial novel and distills Davey’s methodology: Her art is rooted in finding a way to practice and is a record of its own creation.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

By Janique Vigier,An Artist Who Delights in the Minor Key,"Moyra Davey’s work moves freely between photography, video and writing but is united in its unwavering attention to the objects and accidents of everyday life.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/t-magazine/moyra-davey.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/28/t-magazine/moyra-slide-NEX9/moyra-slide-NEX9-articleLarge.jpg,2020-05-29T19:41:01+0000,"In “I Confess,” the final essay in Moyra Davey’s new collection of prose pieces, “Index Cards” (2020), she recalls losing, as a child at school, a pencil given to her by her mother. Thinking it was stolen, she began to sob. Her teacher asked her: “Pourquoi as-tu tant de peine pour un crayon?” (Why so much grief over a pencil?) His question has remained with Davey, the New York-based artist, for 50 years. The anecdote — the triviality of the pencil, the pinprick of a particular line — is emblematic of her art, in which tension comes from small traumas and everyday talismans. Moving between video, photography and prose, Davey’s work is bound by idiosyncratic references and quasi-dreamed connections. An acute chronicler of quotidian life, she is both the narrator and protagonist of her work. She paces her apartment hallways in her videos; she photographs the dust under her bed; she reads and writes restlessly, hoping to find what Walter Benjamin called the “tiny spark of accident” that will set off stray thoughts and images. “Index Cards,” which she wrote between 2003 to 2019, reads like a serial novel and distills Davey’s methodology: Her art is rooted in finding a way to practice and is a record of its own creation.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

New York City has a complicated relationship with silence, given that the people who live there can’t really ever fully experience it. That makes the quiet of “Sidewalk Stories” even more striking. Filmed in black and white and mostly silent (à la Charlie Chaplin), the movie follows a homeless Greenwich Village street artist (played by Charles Lane, who also wrote and directed the film) who cares for an abandoned toddler in 1980s New York. When the movie came out, it was a novel mishmash of early Hollywood technique and a then-contemporary setting. Three decades later, it offers a different viewing experience: it’s a time capsule of 1980s New York. Criterion Channel is showing the movie as a virtual double-feature on Friday, alongside one of its clear influences: Chaplin’s THE KID (1921).",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
