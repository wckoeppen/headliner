In Barcelona, there are more than a dozen bars devoted entirely to it. And though gin has been made in Spain for centuries, only a handful of Spanish gins are sold in the United States for that classic “gintonic,” as it’s said in Spain. The latest arrival is Ginraw, made in Barcelona using two distilling methods: the classic copper pot still to create the spirit and, for introducing ingredients like citrus, laurel and cardamom, a low-temperature distilling technique, which is designed to preserve the essences of the botanicals. The gin is notably silky, with a whiff of spice up front and subtle citric richness on the palate. And for a proper gintonic, until bars and restaurants open their doors in New York City, there’s a cocktail stand outside Socarrat Paella Bar on Manhattan’s East Side, where Spanish-style drinks are mixed and sold along with tapas.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

To read the work of writers from the near and distant past, and some who are still active, is not necessarily to encounter visions of consensus or progress: Culture wars have always been part of the culture.

In addition to being Jewish-American, he’s also part Cuban. A factory in Gloversville, N.Y., produces an array of salami,  dry-cured and long-lasting. The salamis are aged at his base of operations in Long Island City, Queens. He is now offering the large, 1.5-pound black truffle (trufa seca) salami ($45), usually reserved for restaurants, to the general public.
