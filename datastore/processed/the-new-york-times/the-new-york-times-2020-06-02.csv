But, in today’s world, it means starting with takeout. Such is the case for Forsythia at 9 Stanton Street. “In the middle of construction everything went on pause,” said Jacob Siwak, formerly of Olmsted, who is the executive chef and owner. For the rustic Italian restaurant, where Mark Coleman, formerly of Rezdôra, is sous chef, and Brian Maxwell, of Gulfstream in Newport Beach, Calif., is baking, they are waiting until indoor dining restrictions are lifted before opening. In the meantime, it is offering takeout from a temporary East Village location, in a space that’s usually a cooking school. The menu is based on a working sojourn in Italy the men took before the coronavirus pandemic, and has Roman overtones. Focaccia with mortadella, short rib meatballs, supplì cheese and rice balls with asparagus and mushrooms, stuffed pastas like scarpinocc and tortellini, and a brioche bun filled with whipped cream are some of the dishes they’re planning and preparing for four-course takeout menus, $30 per person. The kitchen is open from 4:30 to 6 p.m. daily, except Sundays. Once the Stanton Street location opens, they will close the East Village location and use the bar in front of the Lower East Side restaurant as a takeout counter.
