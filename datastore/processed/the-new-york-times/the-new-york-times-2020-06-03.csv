(2019) 5:15 p.m. on HBO. Sure, plenty of movies chart a young person’s transition into adulthood. But how many feature a boy becoming a man in an instant? The boy here is Billy (Asher Angel), a teenage orphan who is given magic powers that allow him to transform into an adult superhero (Zachary Levi) by saying the word “shazam.” His character is based on a lesser-known DC superhero created in 1939 — but the movie’s blasé humor is very contemporary. It’s “a nice change of pace for a big-screen mega-comic, if not a revolutionary shift,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “The filmmakers (Henry Gayden wrote the script, David F. Sandberg directed) adhere to the heroic template, which means there’s a regulation villain (the reliably watchable Mark Strong) with schemes,” she added. “But they also fill in the faces and places, and add enough shading and color to Billy’s world that when his inevitable fight against evil happens, it feels as if something more than the box office is at stake.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
