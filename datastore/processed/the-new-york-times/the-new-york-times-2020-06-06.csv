An arm may grow six inches overnight. Emotions are even more malleable. No wonder so many of us look back on those years with about as much fondness as we have for cafeteria food. It makes sense, then, that teenagers want so badly to fit in. After all, when you feel like a freak, the desire to blend in with the crowd must be overwhelming. As Ross Maloy, the protagonist of Rob Harrell’s terrific new book, WINK (Dial, 320 pp., $16.99; ages 9 to 12), says: “Can I tell you how sick I am of being different? I hate it!

This thriller transports us into the mind of the eccentric horror writer Shirley Jackson. Fred (Logan Lerman) and Rose (Odessa Young), a young couple, are offered to stay with Shirley (Elisabeth Moss) and her husband Stanley (Michael Stuhlbarg), a professor and literary critic, at their house in Vermont. But the arrangement slowly starts to feel like a trap. Stanley treats Fred as a professional grunt, while Shirley sees Rose as a muse for her next novel. The movie isn’t factual — the filmmaker Josephine Decker (“Madeline’s Madeline”) drew from the novel of the same name by Susan Scarf Merrell. But the formula works. In his review for The New York Times, A.O. Scott wrote that “Shirley is a mystery and a monster, and ‘Shirley’ is at once a sincere tribute and a sly hatchet job.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
