Michaela Coel, the British playwright, actress and star of the Netflix series “Chewing Gum,” is back with a new half-hour drama that explores big ideas about dating, exploitation and consent. Coel plays a popular writer named Arabella, who, during an all-night bender with friends, is drugged and assaulted. “The 12-part series alternates between big-picture stories about Arabella’s similarly sexually adventurous peers and some more subjective and disturbing sequences where she reckons with the lingering trauma of what happened to her,” Noel Murray wrote for The New York Times. He added that the series “is not always an easy show to watch, but it should be a conversation-starter.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
