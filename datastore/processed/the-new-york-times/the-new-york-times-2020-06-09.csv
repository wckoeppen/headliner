They interviewed political activists including Angela Davis, Stokely Carmichael and Bobby Seale, as well as residents of Harlem, Brooklyn and Oakland. About 30 years later, their footage was discovered by a Swedish television network, and the director Goran Hugo Olsson pieced clips together to create this film. He also added voice-over commentary by contemporary figures, like Erykah Badu and Questlove, who explain the movement’s relevance decades later.

In ancient Egypt, it was used to ward off evil forces. Buddhist monks, too, relied (and still rely) on incense to purify their meditation spaces, while in Japan, the Koh-Do (incense ceremony) has been popular since courtiers and samurai took it up in the 16th century.
