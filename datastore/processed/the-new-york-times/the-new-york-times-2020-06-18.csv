Our arches are no less important today and indeed seem to have become newly conspicuous during the past several months, exposed above our face masks or reflected back at us during Zoom calls. “I consider eyebrow grooming to be an art, and there are many ways of going about it,” says Jimena Garcia, a brow sculptor and specialist at Atelier Beauté Chanel in New York City, who, along with many others in her field, has started offering virtual consultations for clients. But no matter how advanced your instruction, fine-tuning your brows at home requires a bit of firsthand experience — and restraint (the temptation to over-pluck is the greatest challenge, Garcia cautions).

A prosecutor in their case was a young Roy Cohn, whose involvement quickly led Senator Joseph McCarthy — a staunch anti-communist Republican — to appoint Cohn to his chief counsel. There, Cohn played a major role in expelling government officials thought to be communists or gay, and shortly thereafter he became a personal lawyer to then-businessman Donald J. Trump. Though Cohn played many prominent roles, much of his personal life was veiled from public view. He was thought to be gay, despite his opposition to homosexuality, and he died from AIDS in 1986.
