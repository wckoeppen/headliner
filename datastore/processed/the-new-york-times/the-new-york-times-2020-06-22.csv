Jacques Rivette’s film from the early 1970s is difficult to summarize, in part because it revolves around the question of whether or not plots actually exist. The main story threads — two separate theater troupes rehearsing different plays by the Greek tragedian Aeschylus: one about a young man hunting for a secret society called the Thirteen; the other about a canny hustler who stumbles across the shadowy cabal — are woven together only to be unraveled. The conspiracy that Colin (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is seeking to uncover, which Frédérique (Juliet Berto) discovers by accident, is similarly ambiguous. It appears to exist — Frédérique seems to find correspondence between its members, and several avowed participants appear in the film — but its power and status are unclear. This tension is never resolved, but over the course of the film’s more than 12 hours, it deepens and becomes more complex.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
