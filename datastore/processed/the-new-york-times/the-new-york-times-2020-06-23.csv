In the evening, there are brined and smoked spatchcocked chickens, whole or half, with side dishes like potatoes cooked in the drippings, and he is also offering prix fixe ($15) “Friends & Family” meals prepared by guest chefs. The idea is to make dinner easy for locals and people with young children, like himself. “We’re two blocks from Prospect Park, so they can take the food and sit on a bench,” he said. His little place does not have seating, and, Mr. Eddy said, it is worth reserving the various set dinners as there are a limited number. There have been Korean meals on weekends from Amy Yi, who was at Upland, but that will change soon. (A barbecue menu starts the weekend of July 4.) The chef Ali Spahr handles pastry, and Kevin Bruce is on breads. Mr. Eddy also plans to open an intimate wine and cocktail bar next door. ",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
