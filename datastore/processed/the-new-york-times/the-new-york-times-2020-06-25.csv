After a couple years off, Dory and company are back, this time on HBO’s new streaming service (the show was on TBS). Season 3 includes a high-stakes criminal trial, chic clothes and cynicism. “‘Search Party,’ has always had a retro-tinged aesthetic, a slight thrift-store defect to its world, which makes it feel surreal at times — part of reality but not identical to it,” Margaret Lyons wrote in a recent edition of The New York Times’s Watching newsletter. “Teasing out the contrast between the weightlessness of an imagined, curated past and the cruel density of the flawed, lived past is one of the show’s most elegant tricks.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
