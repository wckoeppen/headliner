Horror as a vehicle for deeper societal commentary may be having a moment with the success of films like “Get Out” and “Parasite,” but it’s not a new phenomenon. During the Black independent film movement of the 1970s and ’80s, the actor, playwright and filmmaker Bill Gunn made this low-budget vampire flick about an anthropologist who develops an unquenchable thirst for blood after being stabbed with a cursed dagger. But it is “less a horror film than a sensual, scholarly, magic-realist exploration of Black history and Black desire,” A.O. Scott wrote of the film for The New York Times.
