This was a few decades ago, and they were students at a boarding school, so he called the pay phone in her dorm from the pay phone in his. Someone answered and pounded up three flights of stairs to knock on the girl’s door. She was not expecting the call. He was a senior—a grade ahead, but a couple of years older—and he was upset. Crying, she thought, but it was hard to tell, because she barely knew him. He said something about his mom, swallowing his words. He wanted the girl’s help. Please.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

Horseradish in a radicchio salad is one example. For tagliolini al Portonat, a simple restaurant dish, the authors insist on the region’s San Daniele prosciutto, which is sold in the United States.
