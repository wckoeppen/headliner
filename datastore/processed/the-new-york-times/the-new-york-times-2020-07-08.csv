In a recent interview with The New York Times, Charlize Theron looked back on her experience shooting this “Mad Max” sequel. “I feel a mixture of extreme joy that we achieved what we did, and I also get a little bit of a hole in my stomach,” she said. Anyone who’s seen the movie will have a sense that shooting it would have been arduous: It revolves around a high-speed desert chase, with characters vaulting between enormous, rusty vehicles cobbled together from spare parts. The main players — the driver Furiosa (Theron) and the warrior Max (Tom Hardy) — are in perpetual motion, threatened by a crazed leader, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), and an army of his underlings. “The biggest thing that was driving that entire production was fear,” Theron said. “I was incredibly scared, because I’d never done anything like it.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
