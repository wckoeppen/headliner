He grew up in Japan, a descendant of many generations of experts in a kind of decorative needlework called sashiko. Wives of rural, working-class farmers and fishermen developed the stitching technique as early as the 1600s as a means to reinforce and mend their clothing. “The idea is that one jacket would be passed down three generations or more,” Futatsuya says. Different regions developed dozens of patterns, of which Futatsuya knows more than 100; his two favorites are asanoha (six-pointed stars) and shippo (overlapping circles). Since 2017, he has spent hundreds of hours covering jeans he owns in stitched patterns to make them stronger.
