At a settlement in the Oregon Territory in the mid-19th century, two men set up shop on a patch of ground. Their product, fried dough with modest garnish, sells out almost instantly. The secret ingredient? Stolen milk. The buddies who cook up that clever racket are at the heart of this latest western from Kelly Reichardt. When “First Cow” introduces Cookie (John Magaro) and King-Lu (Orion Lee), they’re strangers: Cookie is working as a cook and forager for a group of trappers; King-Lu is on the run. The friendship they develop together — and their covert dairy operation — is explored against a forested frontier backdrop. A.O.
