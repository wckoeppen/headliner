One of the highest-profile titles from NBCUniversal’s new streaming service, Peacock, the show brings to life the futuristic New London, a city where crime and disease are in the past, and residents spend their time popping happy pills and having orgies. At the story’s center are Bernard (Harry Lloyd) and Lenina (Jessica Brown Findlay), two New Londoners who bring a pair of outsiders, played by Alden Ehrenreich and Demi Moore, into the city. While the creators of the series make an effort to cook up a version of Huxley’s vision that feels fresh to 21st-century audiences, James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The New York Times that the show ultimately “transmutes a provocative warning into a vision of a sci-fi world that feels neither brave nor new.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

The glamour wasn’t wasted on Marant, but she had her own ideas. “That era of ’80s super-chic French fashion was really getting on my nerves,” she says. “By 10, I knew exactly what I wanted to wear, but it didn’t exist in any shop.” So she started making her own clothes, reworking her dad’s castoff dressing gowns, sweaters, vintage military fatigues and silk slippers. At one point she thought she might study economics or become a veterinarian, but her friends loved her creations and kept requesting versions for themselves. After studying fashion design at Paris’s Studio Berçot, Marant launched Twen, a knitwear and jersey line, with her mother in 1989. “I was determined to work for myself,” she says. Her eponymous label debuted five years later, with a collection of men’s-wear-inspired overcoats and striped suits that drew from Indonesian batiks and ikats. Her credo was simple: She’d only design pieces she herself would wear. “To this day,” says Marant, 53, “nothing leaves the workshop without me trying it on.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
