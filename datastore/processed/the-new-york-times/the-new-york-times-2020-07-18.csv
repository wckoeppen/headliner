This documentary, which was directed by the New York Times journalists Catrin Einhorn and Leslye Davis, has been 10 years in the making. Though much has been reported about the hardships some soldiers and their families face upon returning home from combat, this film focuses on one family and chronicles its changing dynamic. It begins in 2010, when Master Sgt. Brian Eisch, a single father, leaves two young sons for a yearlong deployment in Afghanistan. He then returns home following a serious injury, which requires his leg to be amputated below the knee. His experience at war and back at home — where he not only struggles physically, but with a loss of identity — ultimately affects what his sons hope for their own futures. “Life, in ‘Father Soldier Son’ does not move in a circle,"" Jessica Kiang wrote in her review for The New York Times, “but in an incrementally decaying orbit around the values that, in making us what we are, also keep us from being anything else.""",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
