That people like Young and Zazeela can still be found in TriBeCa in 2020 is nothing short of remarkable. Young is certainly the lone musician alive today who can claim to be no more than two degrees removed from three of the greatest icons of 20th-century modern music: Igor Stravinsky (who taught Robert Stevenson, the musicologist who was Young’s mentor in college), Charlie Parker (who played with the saxophonist Lee Konitz, with whom Young himself played as a session musician in Los Angeles) and Lou Reed (who co-founded the Velvet Underground with one of Young’s bandmates, John Cale). He is often considered the founder of minimalist music, having stripped composition down to its bare elements of rhythm, sound and tempo as early as the late ’50s. His compositions can alternate between abrasive (the 30-minute-long “Day of Niagara,” recorded in 1965 with Zazeela, along with Cale and sometime Velvet Underground collaborators Tony Conrad and Angus MacLise, is a loud score that sounds not unlike an airplane engine and predated the noise rock of Reed’s “Metal Machine Music” and other staples of early punk by about a decade) and hauntingly beautiful (such as 1958’s “Trio for Strings,” a three-hour piece that effectively created the language of minimalist music through the use of sustained tones punctuated by brief gasps of silence). In the 1960s, he introduced generations of musicians to the concepts of drones and sustained repetition and began incorporating Indian classical music into his work, about five years before George Harrison had ever heard of the sitar.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
