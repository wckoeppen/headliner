Back then, in the 1960s and ’70s, he was a latchkey kid who whiled away the afternoons playing in an abandoned ammunition depot on a former Japanese Imperial Army site. At night, he’d listen obsessively, either using the family radio or one he’d built himself at age 8, to the Far East Network, an American station that served the area with news and tunes. Over these airwaves, he found Western music. Folk music. Rock music. He heard voices in a strange foreign language — English — and because he couldn’t understand the lyrics, these voices became just another sound alongside the guitars. And so he became an improbable, insatiable witness to Western pop’s evolution from the flower-child bliss of the mid-60s to the ecstatic thrash of late ’70s punk.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
