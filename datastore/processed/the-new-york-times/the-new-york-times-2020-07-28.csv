Peris, an associate professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles, where she is co-director of the Child O.C.D., Anxiety and Tic Disorders Program.

Nail biting tends to begin in childhood and adolescence, but researchers estimate that as much as 30 percent of Americans are chronic nail biters. Often a form of self-soothing, the disorder can, over time, disrupt the functioning of a brain’s reward circuitry. An occasional nibble probably isn’t concerning, but if you gnaw until you injure yourself — if your fingers are bloody or infected — or if the biting distracts or shames you, you should know that you can get help.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
