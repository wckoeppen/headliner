Encouraged by books, I’d always been the type of Gothic amateur naturalist who preserved interesting bits of the dead. I cleaned and polished fox skulls; disarticulated, dried and kept the wings of roadkill birds. But I knew, looking at the swift, that I could not do anything like that to it.

It was in early May the next year, as soon as I saw the first returning swifts flowing down from the clouds, that I knew what I had to do.
