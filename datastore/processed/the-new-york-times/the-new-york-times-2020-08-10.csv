The groom, seated next to her, wore a paisley-printed ski jacket, its high, mouth-covering neck pre-empting the protective masks of the pandemic. An older community leader in a black suit presided over the faux ceremony in Farsi, as the viewers sat divided by gender — men on one side of the aisle, women on the other, though the men outnumbered the women and ended up infringing on their section. This was a deliberate move on Farzaneh’s part intended to highlight the power imbalance she feels in her industry — where a woman truly at the helm of her own brand is still something of a rarity — and was typical of the subtle gestures toward the tensions of our present moment that are embedded in her line. At the end of the ceremony, the groom rose and strode down the aisle, followed by a procession of young men dressed in looks from the fall 2020 collection of Farzaneh’s namesake line, which combined the swagger and oversize silhouettes of streetwear with the understated, earthy palette of hand-printed Iranian textiles.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
