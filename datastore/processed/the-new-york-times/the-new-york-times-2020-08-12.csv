Thirty-one years ago this month, Yusuf Hawkins was killed in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn, in what became one of the city’s most notorious hate crimes and a sign of its racial divisions in the 1980s and ’90s. This documentary revisits the case — in which Hawkins, a Black teenager, was pursued by a mob of white youths, then shot — through archival footage and interviews with Hawkins’s family. Also interviewed are public figures like the Rev. Al Sharpton, who led protests after the killing and helped turn the case into an argument for change. “I don’t know who shot Yusuf,” Sharpton said at Hawkins’s funeral in 1989, “but the system loaded the gun.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
