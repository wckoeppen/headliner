Then there’s Louis Vuitton’s signature monogram canvas, with its interlaced L and V flanked by various geometric flowers, which seems to be another thing entirely, one impervious to trends and maybe even time itself. In fact, the monogram hasn’t always been around, nor does it date to the house’s founding in 1854, when Louis Vuitton, who had previously been a packer for Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III, began selling travel trunks out of a store on Paris’s Rue Neuve-des-Capucines, just off Place Vendôme. His go-to motif was a waterproof gray canvas. The monogram came into existence just over four decades later, when Louis’s son, Georges, took inspiration from the kitchen tiles of the family’s home in Asnières in north-central France. The house, built in 1859, was decorated in the Art Nouveau style, and the tile pattern featured a trio of flowers outlined by a clover that was in turn set within a circle, as well as diamonds with petal-like points. Another reference may have been the Gothic Revival then sweeping through France — when seen through that lens, the monogram can’t help but recall architectural quatrefoils carved out of stone or glass in the era’s great cathedrals. What is certain is that, in designing it, Georges was acting in honor of his father, who had died four years prior, leaving the brand’s legacy in his son’s hands.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

Currently the most reliable way to identify a coronavirus infection is by a polymerase chain reaction (P.C.R.) test: A swab, usually taken from the nasal passage, produces a sample that is then sent to a specialized laboratory. P.C.R. tests, which can detect minute amounts of genetic material from the virus, cost upward of $100; in ideal circumstances, they take just hours to analyze. But because of high demand, supply shortages and other issues, many commercial labs are taking more than a week to process them. That means a positive test often comes back too late to enable contact tracers to notify those who have been exposed before they might in turn infect others. In these circumstances, the diagnosis is useful only for making personal health decisions and providing data on the rate of infection in a community.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
