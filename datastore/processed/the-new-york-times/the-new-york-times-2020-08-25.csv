I recently hosted a few women at a small get-together to celebrate a birthday. All four of us have been close for many years. In the course of conversation, we began to discuss current events, including the death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement. This friend said that she couldn’t see why Black lives should matter to us (we are all white) when Black lives don’t even seem to matter to other Blacks. She cited Black-on-Black crime and, in particular, the recent death of a young African-American girl who was killed by a stray bullet in a drive-by shooting. (I should mention that all of us live in an affluent, predominantly white suburb of a major metropolitan city that is predominantly Black and poor. Prior to the pandemic, this city was experiencing something of a renaissance but still had a long way to go.) Our friend also noted that she was disgusted by the outpouring of attention and love at George Floyd’s funeral. After all, she said, he did not live a very virtuous life and did not deserve to be “treated like a saint.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

Chapo Guzmán, the world-famous drug lord, had hired a young IT guy and the kid had built him a sophisticated system of high-end cell phones and secret servers, all of it ingeniously encrypted. The unconfirmed report—perhaps that was the best way to describe it—had arrived that Friday in June 2009 when a tipster walked into the lobby of the FBI’s field division office in New York. After his story had been vetted downstairs, it made its way up seven flights of stairs and landed with a curious thud among the crowded cubicles of C-23, the Latin American drug squad. For more than thirty years, the elite team of agents and their bosses had hunted some of the drug trade’s biggest criminals, and while tall tales of their antics circulated constantly through its squad room near the courts in Lower Manhattan, no one in the unit knew what to make of this one. The tipster’s account seemed credible enough but it was sorely lacking details: the only facts he had offered on the young technician were a first name—Christian—and that he was from Medellín, Colombia. All sorts of kooks spouting all sorts of nonsense showed up all the time at FBI facilities, claiming they had inside information on the Kennedy killing or knew someone who knew someone who knew where Jimmy Hoffa was. In what were still the early days of Internet telephony, it seemed a bit far-fetched that a twentysomething hacker had reached a deal with the world’s most wanted fugitive and furnished him in hiding with a private form of Skype. As alluring as it sounded, it was just the sort of thing that would probably turn out to be a myth.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
