In the blink of an eye, a sputtering first date turns into a high-stakes run from the law in “Queen & Slim,” the debut feature from the music-video and television creator Melina Matsoukas. The story begins in an Ohio diner: Queen (Jodie Turner-Smith) and Slim (Daniel Kaluuya) meet for dinner, after connecting via a dating app. It’s awkward. On their way home, they are pulled over by a police officer (Sturgill Simpson) — an encounter that turns deadly. Suddenly fugitives, Queen and Slim then run from the law while news of their encounter sparks nationwide attention and protest. The screenplay, by Lena Waithe, taps into urgent conversations about race in America. “I don’t want this movie to be as relevant as it is,” Waithe said in an interview with The New York Times when the film came out. “But the scary thing is the movie becomes more and more relevant with every passing day.” That was late last year.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
