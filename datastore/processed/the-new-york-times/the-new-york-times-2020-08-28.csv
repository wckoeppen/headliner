When hardy audiences trek to theaters to see Christopher Nolan’s latest mind-bender, “Tenet,” in theaters next week, they can expect two things: masks in the movie house and puzzles on the screen. For that has been the Nolan way for nearly two decades: In 2001, Nolan’s “Memento” offered “a series of clever epistemological puzzles,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. Nolan’s film “The Prestige,” from 2006, “has a satisfyingly puzzlelike structure,” Scott wrote in his review. The filmmaker’s 2010 dream-hopper, “Inception”? It “trades in crafty puzzles,” Scott wrote. “Interstellar” in 2014? “Tantalizing puzzles,” Manohla Dargis wrote. All echo “Following,” Nolan’s 1998 debut feature, which gave a taste of his knack for cinematic discombobulation. Shot on a shoestring — the cost of making “Following,” reported to be in the low thousands, was surely less than the hair gel budget delegated to the men of “Inception” — the film plays fast and loose with chronology, telling the story of a young Londoner (Jeremy Theobald), whose hobby of tailing strangers leads him to the city’s criminal underbelly. In her review for The Times, Janet Maslin called the movie “a black-and-white film noir with a difference,” writing that “the usual elements of scheming and deception are well represented here, but they are made all the knottier by shifting time frames.” And, she noted, the story “offers plenty of intriguing puzzle pieces.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
