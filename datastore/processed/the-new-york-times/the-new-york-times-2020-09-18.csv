To be clear, mushrooms don’t cure Covid-19, but they are thought to provide a host of other benefits, from serving as an aphrodisiac to bolstering one’s defenses to toxins. As Ligaya Mishan explains in her essay for T’s Fall Men’s issue, Eastern cultures have long been enthusiastic about edible fungi, both in culinary and health contexts — mushrooms are rich in umami, the Japanese “fifth taste” that denotes savoriness, and woody species such as reishi are often prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine — while the West has been more ambivalent. Today, though, American cooks and diners delight in foraged morels and matsutakes, while others mix mushroom-based powders into shakes and teas. In an article published in 2014 — over 80 years after the British scientist Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, the powerful group of antibiotics derived from the fungus Penicillium — the mycologist Paul Stamets, best known for the TED Talk “6 Ways Mushrooms Can Save the World,” described mushrooms as “nature’s miniature pharmaceutical factories.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

Once reserved for the cigar rooms of English gentlemen’s clubs, Saint Laurent’s black grain de poudre blazer with silk satin lapels, worn with a cummerbund, ruffled jabot blouse and bow tie over side-striped slacks, shocked the sartorial world: It was the first time a women’s designer had presented trousers for evening wear. But it quickly became the uniform of liberated women: The model Bianca Jagger wore a white version when she married Mick in 1971. The singer Françoise Hardy arrived at the opera in Paris dressed in a Smoking (and was heckled). And when the socialite Nan Kempner was famously turned away from the Manhattan restaurant La Côte Basque while wearing the tux (their dress code prohibited women from wearing pants), she slipped off her trousers and turned the blazer into a minidress. Saint Laurent would include a variation of Le Smoking in each of his collections until he retired in 2002, designing over 200 of them.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
