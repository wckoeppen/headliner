In the aughts, when his focus was apparel (he ran Edun, the clothing company started by Bono and his wife, Ali Hewson), he created loose silhouettes from linen and cotton dyed with coffee, blue corn and gardenia blossoms. In recent years, he has concentrated on furniture, lighting and sculpture, all with his signature futuristic, biomorphic contours, using bronze, gypsum, wood and plaster. This massive fireplace surround may be the ultimate expression of his aesthetic: Just over eight feet tall and nearly as wide, it is sculpted from a heat-tolerant marble composite that has a velvety matte finish — the stone is ground to a powder and combined with resin and ceramic fiber insulation.
