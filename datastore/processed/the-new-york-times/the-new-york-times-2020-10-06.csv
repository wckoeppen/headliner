The first images we see are not Bradley’s but Fox Rich’s: a riot of black-and-white home recordings that stutter-step through time. One moment Fox Rich addresses the audience, vowing that she and her family will survive despite her husband’s sentence. As proof, she offers her pregnant belly — she’s carrying twins.

There are also some à la carte and sushi omakase options. He said he was able to rehire about half of his staff so far. And, with an eye to year-round outdoor dining, he has created an all-weather outside area, seating 120, with planters, a generous overhang and heaters. Inside, there is socially distant seating for 30. “The idea is to bring the indoor restaurant outside,” Mr. Moreira said. “It cost me $250,000, but I really spent the money to stay alive.” ",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
