Once, she climbed on my back and began combing the mustache with her fingers, whispering in the warmest tones of endearment, “Uncle Wesley, when are you going to shave this thing off?”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

Sick and tired of working in kitchens, unseen and uncelebrated, stalling out while the people around him came up. In 1940, working in obscurity as a caterer, he lifted a recipe from his colleagues Irma Rhode and her brother Bill Rhode — known as New York’s king of hors d’oeuvres — and published it as his own. It was a cute cocktail sandwich of soft, buttery bread and finely sliced onion called brioche en surprise, a hit at the events he and the Rhodes had worked together. But as Beard became more famous, the sandwich got a new, unofficial name: James Beard’s onion sandwich. Beard earned (along with a reputation for chronic, unapologetic plagiarism) his own nickname, the Dean of American Cookery. It was a good nickname, a strong nickname, though in suggesting a kind of elite prep school tucked away from the real world, it also gave away some truths about the small circle of people defining American food: They were insular, petty and competitive. And if Beard was their dean — a champion of American regional ingredients and the cooks who supported them — he was also a fragile and sometimes predatory influencer, an outsider aching for companionship and financial success.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
