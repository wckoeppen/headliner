With his siblings already out of the house, Smith spent his adolescent years luxuriating in the company of his parents, snapping photographs that he’d develop with his father in the family attic and taking long bike rides through the Midlands. At 15, he left school intent on becoming a professional cyclist, but was forced to give up the pursuit after suffering a bad crash two years later, at which point he started spending weekends in London, hanging out with an art and music school crowd that opened his eyes to the cultural currents of the 1960s. Often, he’d go to concerts and hawk homemade silk-screened T-shirts he’d made to whomever was performing (Rod Stewart, Eric Clapton) and use some of his earnings to pay for the gas to get home. “I came from a working-class family and I had no money, no education,” says Smith. “I had to make it work, and I liked clothes.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
