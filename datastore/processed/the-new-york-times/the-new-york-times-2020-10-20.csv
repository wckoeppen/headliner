Over the decades, they manufactured traveling goods for royals, fin de siècle explorers and their jet-setting clientele — and created custom carrying kits for everything from books and cigars to perfumes and polo gear. Perhaps their most famous special order, however, came in 1932, when Gaston-Louis Vuitton (the founder’s grandson) received a request from a champagne producer who wanted him to design a leather bag he could give as a gift to his clients. He had only two requirements: It should bear the weight of multiple bottles and stand the test of time. Gaston went to work, and soon the Noé was born. With its tapered rectangular base, the versatile bucket bag could fit five bottles of bubbly: four standing upright and one flipped upside down in the center. A drawstring closure prevented them from breaking or clanking.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

Many of Tuymans’s notable early paintings concern the Holocaust, including “Gas Chamber” (1986), which he adapted from a watercolor he painted on-site at Dachau, and “Schwarzheide” (1986), based on a background detail of pine trees from a 1945 drawing of the titular concentration camp by survivor Alfred Kantor.
