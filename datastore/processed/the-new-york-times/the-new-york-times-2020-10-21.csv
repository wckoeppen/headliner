Julia was the beloved cookbook author and television pioneer Julia Child, and the project was a television series and cookbook. Writing the book was my job, and I was headed to Julia’s house in Cambridge, Mass., to sort out recipes and chapters. I walked in through the side door — in the months I worked at her home, I don’t think anyone ever came through the front entrance — and up the steps to the kitchen. I’d been inside a few times, but walking into the big, cheery room and knowing that I’d soon see Julia was still a happy moment for me. A couple of the walls were covered in pegboard with hooks and outlines of the pots and pans Julia hung on them. The cupboards were pale green, the color of the milky glass dishes my grandmother used. The counters were topped with well-worn butcher block. And the stove was her treasured Garland, which she bought in 1956 and said she would take to her grave. (It’s in the Smithsonian now.) It was black and rough and had six burners, and on the day I’m thinking of, half of them were fired up and tended by Stephanie Hersh, Julia’s assistant from 1989 until 2004, when Julia died.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
