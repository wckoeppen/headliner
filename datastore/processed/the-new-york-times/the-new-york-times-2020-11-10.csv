Greater emphasis was placed on the spacious outdoor terrace, with partial enclosures and heaters to permit dining in colder weather. Inside, the bar will not be available for seating but will display retail baked goods, including Mr. Strausman’s bagels, baked in-house and made popular during his many years as the executive chef for Fred’s at Barneys. Touch-free systems for ordering and paying are in place. An airy room, done in pale wood tones, is divided into two areas with seating for a total of 26 at the moment. Part of the kitchen is set aside for takeout and delivery. “It’s probably going to make up almost half of our business from what I can see,” he said. “This winter, it will be the norm.” The menu lists what Mr. Strausman calls his “greatest hits,” including Estelle’s chicken soup, lasagna della nonna, sautéed chicken livers, smoked fish platters and coffee cake for brunch.

These were largely (though not exclusively) midcentury dwellings — some neglected, others wildly overgrown — on or in the park that seemed to reify my sense of the city’s layered strangeness, of its mystery and opportunity for discovery. Even more than other European cities, Berlin is marked by the remains of all kinds of ideologies past, from the TV Tower in the vast main square, Alexanderplatz, a retro-future icon erected in the late 1960s by the East German government in a now poignant display of might, to the buildings the Nazis left behind. (Hitler never did fully realize his vision of a rebuilt Berlin as the capital of “Germania,” but the kind of neo-Classical bombast he had in mind is evident in the Olympic Stadium, which he commissioned shortly after he took power in 1933 and was completed in time for the 1936 Summer Games, and the limestone Tempelhof Airport terminal, which was constructed between 1936 and 1941 and, following the war, became a site of the airlift that sustained the city with food and supplies when Stalin blocked access to West Berlin.) All architecture conveys a set of narratives, histories and values for how best to live, and today’s Berlin, a jumble of tragedy and utopian ambitions past — and, these days, encroaching foreign investment — can feel like an especially dark choose-your-own-adventure story.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
