In 1917, he flipped over a couple of discarded photographs and sketched a folding screen, coloring it with tempera and pencil. The drawing remained unpublished until it appeared in a 1968 Balla monograph, but now Cassina has produced the partition, silk-screened on both sides of an asymmetrically cut wooden armature with satin-brass hinges.
