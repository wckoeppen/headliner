Many of the house’s most arresting designs were created in the ’50s and ’60s, including the 1969 sautoir necklace — a heart-shaped emerald pendant, weighing over 127 carats, surrounded by cabochon-cut gems of ruby, citrine, amethyst, turquoise and topaz. Shortly after it came off the workbench, the piece — which converted into two bracelets — was shot for American Vogue, its magnificent links draped across the model Veruschka’s scarf-covered head. It was then bought by a Genevese collector, who purchased it for his wife. Decades later, Bulgari came across a 1975 oil portrait of a woman wearing what looked to be the very same necklace. Two years ago, the house bought back the piece when it came up for auction at Sotheby’s and returned it to its archives.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
