Stacks of boxes filled with books and products she’d made, as well as paintings — both her own and ones she’d purchased — lined the walls, and the countertops of the kitchenette were barely visible beneath the countless cases of spray paint piled on top of them. When the pandemic hit New Jersey in March, and the state went into lockdown, Abney — who also lives in the building, in an apartment a few flights below — became even more aware of her spatial confines. And so, in May, she bought a bike and a rack for her car and began taking road trips to rural areas outside of the city to find some relief from all the time spent indoors. Inspired in part by these excursions, Abney’s new body of work conveys a sense of expansiveness — one that she also found in the form of an additional studio that she rented in the same building this fall.
