The show’s about a nice married duo that ascends the ranks of a drug cartel. Dukes is the pregnant fed investigating their finances. Burke is their couples therapist. Both are divine.

Everybody’s lying to her and the thrill of her performance comes from the poise she maintains amid the flagrant insults to her intelligence. She must have a dozen ways of doing, “How dumb do you think I am?” Burke, meanwhile, is a bag of Sour Patch Kids — glamorously wizened, blithe in both her wisdom and corruptibility. They make that candy with acid and sugar. They’re addictive and, when there’s none left, it’s awful. (Streaming on Netflix.)",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

To one diner, this is a promise of pleasure; to another, a teetering on the abyss. Westerners have never quite understood the reverence in Japan for fugu, alternately known in English as puffer fish, globefish or blowfish, of the family Tetraodontidae. A sluggish swimmer, fugu has stunted fins and often flat-lying spikes instead of scales, and when confronted by predators it compensates for its lack of speed by swallowing enough water to swell up until its spikes stand on end, so it looks like an angry armored balloon. Among those who think of fugu as merely a distant delicacy, knowledge rarely goes beyond the fish’s infamous trait: In the most delicious species, the innards are suffused with the neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin (TTX). In high enough doses, this can shut down a diner’s nerve impulses and cause, within hours, nausea, paralysis and the stalling of the heart, which only knows to beat because our body’s electrical system tells it to.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
