So the idea that the agency wrote a popular heavy metal song, one that helped thaw the Cold War? Maybe not so crazy. In this eight-episode audio documentary, soft power meets power ballad. The New Yorker writer Patrick Radden Keefe investigates an irresistible rumor — that the C.I.A. composed the Scorpions’ 1990 glasnost-positive anthem, “Wind of Change.” On a shaggy dog international tour, Keefe interviews ex-spies, shadowy music industry figures and the Scorpions’ frontman, Klaus Meine. But this is ultimately a podcast about a conspiracy theory and, as with most conspiracy theories, the solid evidence is thinner than a vinyl pressing.
