This got me thinking about what my own bare-minimum criteria for poetry might be. A bag of dirt in a gallery might be an installation, but I wasn’t quite willing to concede it could also be a poem — a poem must at least, on some level, I thought, be verbal. But was that quite right? What about Aram Saroyan’s famous visual poems, in particular the lowercase m with an extra hump — not even a word or part of a word; an unletter. Maybe poetry only requires typography — but doesn’t it also require sound, the sense that at least in theory you could hear the poem? I do feel I can “read” that long m — it has a sonic quality — and the Saroyan poem “lighght.” An ampersand alone on a page would represent a pronounceable word. But what about a parenthesis, or a semicolon?",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

They have put Alan Delgado in charge of the new kitchen, where the food is vegetarian and mostly vegan. Mr. Delgado, who is from Texas and worked there for many years, recently became involved in recipe development for Oxomoco before taking on this position. Some of his specialties for breakfast and lunch, the only meals being served for now in the restaurant’s elaborate outdoor dining area, are a masa pancake with maple syrup and salted butter; braised carrot tostada with navy beans, carrot top salsa verde and spiced maple; and churros with Oaxacan chocolate. (They’re also available for takeout and delivery.) The corn used here and at Oxomoco comes from Tamoa, a Mexican organization that connects farmers growing heritage crops with restaurants in Mexico and the United States. The restaurant has a vibrant mural covering its facade; when dining indoors is permitted, customers will see a room decorated with desert plants and hand-woven textiles in purple, yellow and orange that echo the colors of corn.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
