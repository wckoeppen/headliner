He had come from the N.F.L., where his most recent job was chief operating officer for the Minnesota Vikings. The first African-American commissioner of a major college conference, he had almost no experience in college sports. He was regarded as an outsider, a perception he shared. To help overcome that, Warren had intended to hold a town-hall meeting on each of the 14 Big Ten campuses during his first year as commissioner. The conference fielded 350 teams across 28 sports, and Warren planned to see every one of them in action. When the pandemic hit in early March, he had seen 105 teams play and hosted three town halls. He still barely knew the university presidents and chancellors, who hired him, or the athletic directors. Unlike his predecessor, Jim Delany, whose tenure as commissioner lasted three decades, Warren had no particular friends or allies among either group. And now he faced one of the most consequential decisions in conference history: Should the Big Ten play football in 2020?",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
