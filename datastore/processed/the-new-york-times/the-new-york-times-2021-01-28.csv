Another iconic motif arrived 25 years ago with Prada’s spring 1996 collection, arguably one of the designer’s most influential. Dubbed Banal Eccentricity — the show notes cited a 1980 exhibition at the Venice Biennale featuring mass-produced ordinary household objects — it hewed to a palette of avocado greens, rusty ochers and eggplant purples, which featured on solid-colored minimalist pieces and those with squiggly, hand-scribbled plaids that took cues from midcentury wallpaper and kitchen design. Another print — which was composed of overlapping abstract squares inspired by 1950s Formica-tiled countertops and appeared on gabardine midlength overcoats and pencil skirts — became synonymous with the concept of ugly chic. If that now seems like an overused descriptor, revisiting the collection is a reminder of the brand’s ever-prescient vision. Ushered onto the runway by a waifish brigade that included Kate Moss and a pixie-haired Carolyn Murphy, it stood in stark contrast to the slick sexiness of Armani and Tom Ford’s Gucci — and it subverted traditional notions of good taste, and even earned comparisons to Dior’s New Look. “If I have done anything, it was making ugly cool,” Mrs. Prada herself once said. “Ugly is attractive, ugly is exciting.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
