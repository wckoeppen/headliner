From there, assorted selections of onigiri are being sold from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., daily through March 7. Previously, the window sold bento boxes, but the management decided to switch to onigiri. One reason was to offer freshly milled rice from the 2020 harvest in Niigata Prefecture, north of Tokyo. It’s being processed at the Rice Factory in Scarsdale, N.Y. The quality of the rice is as essential for onigiri as it is for sushi, but onigiri is more snack than art. Usually offered in tidy nori wraps for easy transport, the fillings are humbler than the masterfully sliced fish of sushi, and include canned tuna with mayonnaise, fried chicken and breaded pork tonkatsu, $3.75 to $5 each. There are also assortments, with side dishes like miso soup and potato croquettes, that can be delivered for an extra fee. Get a couple of these sets and some sake or beer, and you have an izakaya at home. The onigiri come packaged in special paper used for wrapping food for 1,500 years.
