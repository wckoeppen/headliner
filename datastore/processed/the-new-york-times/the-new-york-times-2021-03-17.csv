He never made them into jewelry, but a few years ago, when the family moved into high jewelry to complement its more accessible designs, Evan, now the chief creative officer, realized it was at last time to part with some of his treasures. So far, he has designed nearly 20 pieces using his private stash, including this white-gold diamond chain necklace with a 31-carat Colombian emerald pendant. He had the gem reconfigured into an antique cushion cut, which contrasts with the modern setting. “It’s vulnerable for me to let these stones go because they’re so personal,” he says. “When they’re gone, they’re gone.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
