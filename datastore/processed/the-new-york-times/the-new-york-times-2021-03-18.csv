Since 2011, Sciò has been not only the embodiment of these properties’ glamorously Italian spirit but their creative director and C.E.O. Her father, Robert Sciò, bought Hotel Il Pellicano in 1979 from Patricia Graham, an American heiress, and her British husband, Michael, an ex-R.A.F. fighter pilot, who had built it in the mid-60s as a private villa and club. Its languid, sun-bleached charm was immortalized by the photographer Slim Aarons. These days, it is the 44-year-old Sciò who oversees its 47 rooms and two terrace restaurants.
