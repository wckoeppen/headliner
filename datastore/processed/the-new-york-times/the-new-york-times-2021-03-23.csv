Johnson, however, was a prankster. Like the bunny head he adopted as his trademark — a cartoonish line drawing that appeared in much of his work, often bearing the name of a key figure in 20th-century art — he hopped lightly, merrily across this playing field. Reveling in puns and irreverence (an untitled 1973 collage known as “Jackson Pollock Fillets” includes cut-out recipes for Pollock Fillets Amandine and Barbecued Pollock Burgers), conducting his life as a nonstop performance, he revived the Dada tradition embodied by his hero Marcel Duchamp. In contrast to the grandiosity of Minimal art, land art, Pop Art and other macho midcentury movements, he offered something much humbler: collages or drawings of portable size and wry wit. As a response to Happenings, a term coined by Allan Kaprow to describe the participatory performances that flourished in New York in the early ’60s, Johnson staged Nothings, in which a befuddled audience was sometimes greeted with an empty room. He decamped to Long Island in 1968 — residing eventually in a sanctuary in Locust Valley he called the Pink House, though it wasn’t pink — and over the years his ties to his New York friends weakened.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
