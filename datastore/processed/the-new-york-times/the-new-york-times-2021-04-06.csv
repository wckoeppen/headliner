It was only through luck that I was well enough to see the musical a second time while on book tour, as well as Andrew Scott’s award-winning London performance in “Present Laughter.” Each was exhilarating, but I was always painfully aware of my body.

But it’s their therapeutic properties that have captivated modern scientists. In Japan, shinrin-yoku, or forest bathing — defined as spending time among trees — has been considered a form of preventive medicine since the 1980s, when researchers in Nagano found that the practice lessens stress, boosts immunity and lowers blood pressure. Subsequent studies showed that soaking up the forest environment — the still atmosphere, the verdant scenery, the gentle crunching of twigs underfoot — reduces cortisol (the body’s primary stress hormone) and activates the parasympathetic (self-healing) nervous system. These findings paved the way for other holistic disciplines, including today’s forest medicine (the study of how wooded environments improve health) and ecotherapy (which considers the curative potential of natural settings).",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
