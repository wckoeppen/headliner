He describes how the agave spirits are made, then rolls out the recipes. Some, like the Mezcalexander and the Mezcal Sour are riffs on popular cocktails. Others, including the Elegante, combining mezcal and ginger liqueur, are lovely inventions.

My mother, too, had grown up poor; she’d lived above a dime store, dying to get out. I wondered if that was why, aside from it being November, my parents sent his parents a turkey.
