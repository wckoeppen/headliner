A growing list of restaurants have opened takeout pizza divisions to expand without establishing separate storefronts and kitchens. Now, Breads Bakery, a retailer and cafe near Union Square, has done the same. And it’s with a marquee chef, Wylie Dufresne, who is adding pizza to a career that includes avant-garde molecular food and doughnuts. Mr. Dufresne was a fan of the bakery, got to know Gadi Peleg, the owner, and they decided to collaborate on New York-style pizza. There are four options for the 12-inch pies ($19 each), which must be ordered online, in advance, for pickup. The pizzas will be available starting April 20. The choices are Classic New York, with tomato sauce, mozzarella and Parmesan; Couch Potato, with fingerlings, sour cream, rosemary, scallions, mozzarella and Parmesan; Sketches of Spain, with romesco sauce, grilled ramps, mozzarella and Parmesan; and the Everything, topped with cream cheese, aged mozzarella, everything spice and chives (adding smoked salmon before serving would not be a mistake). There’s also a breakfast calzone filled with scrambled eggs, Muenster and American cheeses, and scallions ($7.50). The mozzarella Mr. Dufresne is using is aged, and the sauces are all homemade.
