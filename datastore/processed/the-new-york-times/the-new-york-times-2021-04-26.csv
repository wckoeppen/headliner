Increasingly, the same is true of Antoni Esteva and Majorca, situated some 130 miles from the Spanish mainland in the sapphire waters of the Mediterranean. Over the past five decades, Esteva, who was born on the island, has dreamed up or transformed dozens of its buildings, from the local artist Miquel Barceló’s home and atelier — which incorporates a 13th-century lookout tower — to the reimagined 18th-century farmhouse that holds the cultish country hotel Son Gener. In 2010, he embarked on a restoration of the artist Joan Miró’s former home in Palma, Majorca’s capital, reorienting the rooms so as to redirect the gaze to the garden. If there is a common thread running through his work, it’s his fondness for employing natural materials and the resulting structures’ tendency to complement, and sometimes even disappear into, the landscape.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
