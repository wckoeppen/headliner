Every possible alternative “milk” — pressed from beans, grains, nuts and so forth — now beckon as vanilla and chocolate in the frozen food aisle. A newcomer, Wildgood, has taken a somewhat different approach, with a vegan frozen dessert that relies on olive oil. It’s the result of eight years of trial and error by Sotiris Tsichlopoulos, who studied gelato in Italy and created an ice cream brand in Greece. Among the ingredients that help turn extra-virgin olive oil into a frozen confection are chicory root, pea protein and carob-bean gum. It’s around 10 percent fat, and there are eight flavors: chocolate, vanilla bean, coffee, mango, mint-chocolate chip, sea salt caramel and the best of the lot, pistachio and chocolate-hazelnut. Perhaps using nuts helps with the texture because despite the olive oil, the end result has more of an ice milk lightness instead of the dense richness of a super-premium product. Mr. Tsichlopoulos’s company has support from Gary Hirshberg, a founder of Stonyfield Farm, among others.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

The winery, established in 1979, released the 2019 sauvignon blanc on a limited basis last summer; now the 2020 is widely available. It’s a lovely summer quaff. “The climate and soils of northern Sonoma County are ideal for producing world-class Bordeaux varietals, particularly sauvignon blanc,” said Craig McAllister, the head winemaker. Bordeaux is the operative term here. The wine, in a clear Bordeaux-style bottle, displays more subtle fruit, notably citrus and pineapple, integrated with good acidity, than the grassy herbaceousness typical of sauvignon blancs from other regions. What La Crema has done echoes Sonoma-Cutrer’s introduction in 2015 of its first sauvignon blanc.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
