To avoid mishandling during distribution and retail sale, he ships them directly to chefs and consumers. Until now he’s made two oils, one that’s exceedingly rich and another, somewhat lighter one, both of which have been recognized for quality by the University of Florence. Now he is introducing a third oil, called the Oil of Life, which is somewhat less expensive than the others and more suited, he says, to everyday home use. It is still an assertive oil, greenish gold, with fresh, herbal aromas and that typical Tuscan bite on the palate. This oil is bottled in thick black glass designed to protect against oxidation. There’s a rotating series of bottle designs, but the oil inside each is the same.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

I was in my grandmother’s house in Delhi. I was 13, maybe 14. We had a family perfumer, or attarwallah, a man of some refinement, who came to us from Lucknow — a city that is a metonym for high Indo-Islamic culture. We didn’t know the attarwallah’s name, or how he knew to follow us from address to change of address. But he came without fail two or three times a year. A slim, gliding figure, with a mouth reddened from paan, or betel leaf and areca nut, the attarwallah produced his wares from carved bottles of colored glass that he carried in a black leather doctor’s bag. He showed us scents according to which season we were in. So in winter, musk and patchouli; in summer, white-flowered varieties of jasmine — of which there are some 40 odd in India — as well as rose and vetiver. In the monsoon, he brought us mitti attar, which imitates the smell of parched earth exhaling after the first rain (“mitti” means “mud” in Hindi). The perfumes came from the medieval Indian town of Kannauj, which is a 75-mile drive west of Lucknow and which, like its French counterpart, Grasse, has a tradition of perfume manufacturing several centuries old. Once he had drawn his perfume out on white cotton buds at the tips of long, thin sticks, the attarwallah lingered over his customers, telling stories of the various scents and reciting the odd romantic couplet of Urdu poetry.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

In the kitchen, she prepared the woman’s hair for a wash by removing the extensions that she had previously put in, using her shears to snip the tiny stitches that fastened the wefts — individual strands of hair that are sewn together to create extensions — to her client’s cornrows. Once she had taken those out, LaVar began to unravel the minuscule braids she had plaited months before, starting at the nape. Using her fingers, she carefully unwound them section by section, until all that was left was the woman’s natural hair. After her client took a shower in one of her four bathrooms, LaVar blow-dried her hair and, over the next hour, once again braided each section of the soft hair into thin cornrows.
