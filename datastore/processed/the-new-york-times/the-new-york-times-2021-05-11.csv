In Egypt’s Karnak village, beginning in the 16th century B.C., temples served as early shops and produced scented oils used for perfuming the living, embalming the dead, softening the skin and hair, covering up bad breath and easing sore muscles. In 17th-century Europe, apothecaries sold raw materials — plant oils, mineral powders — that enabled patrons to whip up their own potions to disguise concerns such as gray hair and wrinkles. And as the definition of beauty has evolved, so, too, has the function of the beauty shop. Today, when we tend to think of beauty in more holistic terms, the places that sell creams, powders and pigments are often more than merely points for picking up curative goods: They can be sanctuaries for gathering, broadening the mind, stimulating the senses and perhaps even stirring the soul. In a year when it’s been difficult to physically visit shops, their value has never been more apparent. Here, as part of T’s Beauty & Luxury issue, we pay tribute to just some of our favorite beauty institutions — the sort of spots that feel like discoveries — from a centuries-old perfumery in New Delhi to a sustainably minded apothecary in Vienna to a futuristic emporium-cum-gallery in Seoul.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

Now, an underused terrace on the 11th floor is being turned into an outdoor dining area, protected by red umbrellas, warmed with heaters and featuring a close-up view of the Empire State Building. It will serve cocktails and offer a dinner menu that’s an abridged version of the menu at Ai Fiori. The chef is Lauren DeSteno, the executive chef for Ai Fiori and a corporate executive chef for the Altamarea Group, where she oversees fine dining for restaurants including Ai Fiori and Marea. The chef Michael White, who was a founding partner of the restaurant group, is no longer involved with the company, according to Ahmass Fakahany, the founding partner who runs the company. Mr. White did not respond to inquiries from The Times. Now, Mr. Fakahany has been concentrating on promoting the women in his organization. “We have so much talent there,” he said. (In addition to Ms. DeSteno, Molly Nickerson has been the executive chef at Marea for the past two years, and Rachel Pancho is Ai Fiori’s pastry chef.) Osteria Morini and Nicoletta are the exceptions, in the hands of Bill Dorrler, also a corporate executive chef who oversees the many Morinis in the company’s portfolio. For the new terrace, Ms. DeSteno, 38, a Culinary Institute of America graduate who worked at Eleven Madison Park and has been with Altamarea for 12 years, has created a multilayered artichoke lasagna made with spinach pasta and a cloud of pecorino. She has not worked in Italy but has visited often. Her responsibilities with the company have also taken her to Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, and elsewhere in the Middle East.
