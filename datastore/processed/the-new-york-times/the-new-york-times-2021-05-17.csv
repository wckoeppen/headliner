The name of both the meat and the ranch comes from the carrots used by the Pettit family as feed for the animals, which are grass-fed in open pastures but finished on a diet of carrots. The ranch started adding carrots from local farms to the finishing feed in 1989; now it’s all carrots because it liked the results. Chefs, including Wolfgang Puck and Gordon Ramsay, did too, and became regular customers. The beef — available in New York strip, rib-eye, filet mignon, tomahawk and hibachi strips, with other cuts coming soon — is now being sold retail for the first time through Holy Grail Steak Company. Each cut is shipped frozen and is available in a regular grade or prestige, the equivalent of prime.
