Perhaps that is, in part, why it has endured for two centuries. When it was built in 1823, as a residence for the branch of the Roosevelt family that would eventually produce Franklin Delano, it stood at the edge of the city, its north-facing facade looking out upon a mostly rural view. Within a few decades, though, the urban frontier had swept past it — the fancy people had moved on to Bond Street and Washington Square, and waves of immigrants crowded into the surrounding tenements. And so the house came to stand on a borderline between neighborhoods, its quoined corners and Dutch roofline attesting to its erstwhile respectability. It was the perfect choice for the two sisters who rented it in 1857.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
