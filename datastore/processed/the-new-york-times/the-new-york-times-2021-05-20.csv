What if, he suggested, they entered a different kind of marriage, one not bound by convention and that allowed them both to be free to explore their desire and love for others? “What we have,” he said, according to Carole Seymour-Jones’s 2008 biography, “A Dangerous Liaison,” and to de Beauvoir herself in “The Prime of Life” (1960), “is an essential love; but it’s good if we both experience contingent affairs.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
