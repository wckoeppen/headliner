He opened it just four years ago with Jean-Georges Vongerichten as its marquee chef. Now he is introducing a Peruvian star, Diego Muñoz, to New York to create the food at Popular, the new signature restaurant on the property, and also to oversee the adjacent Cantina & Pisco Bar. Among Mr. Muñoz’s credits are the kitchens of Astrid y Gastón in Lima, Peru, and the Edition in Bodrum, Turkey, another Schrager hotel, as well as other projects in Peru. Working alongside Mr. Muñoz will be John Fraser, another chef in Mr. Schrager’s lineup, who will attend mainly to the restaurant management side of things. Mr. Schrager noted that this collaboration of two top chefs was something he has never done. Mr. Fraser will also curate the prepared grab-and-go items, including some by Mr. Muñoz, at Louis, a ground-floor market and coffee bar. The Cantina & Pisco Bar is a pair of marble counters, one with fresh fish on display for ceviche made to order, the other for cocktails starring pisco. There is also table seating. Popular has indoor and outdoor seating for a menu highlighting the multicultural traditions — African, Chinese, Incan, Italian, Japanese and Spanish  — that shape Peruvian cuisine in many seafood preparations, and also in dishes like papa a la Huancaína, a classic Peruvian potato dish; filet mignon saltado, a dressier version of the staple; salmon tiradito for the Japanese influence; and wood-smoked seafood paella, plus the inevitable burger. There are three wood ovens. On the Cantina & Pisco Bar menu will be razor clams, and hearts of palm with avocado. Louis will offer a ceviche bowl, Peruvian-style sandwiches and also a loaded Chrystie Street kosher hot dog; Mr. Muñoz will be coming up with cocktails at Cantina and Popular, many based on pisco, the grape spirit of Peru. Peruvian and South American selections dominate the wine list. (Opens June 12; reservations accepted from June 5.)",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

It was a Black city. Following the Watts Rebellion — the uprisings that took place in August 1965 in the predominantly Black Watts neighborhood, just north of Compton in southern Los Angeles — white residents who hadn’t already left the area were desperate to get out. By the end of that decade, Compton’s population, which had previously been mostly white, was about 70 percent Black. “The difference between Compton in 1959 and in 1969 is almost like night and day,” says Robert Lee Johnson, a local historian. When the city elected Douglas Dollarhide, its first Black mayor, in 1969, he came into office with a majority Black school board and an entirely Black City Council. But keeping the city middle class was an uphill battle. The mass relocation of white-owned businesses led to sweeping job losses and soon Compton, which had formerly been “known for its housing and schools,” Johnson says, couldn’t afford to maintain either, let alone support the arts.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
