Hiding from the virus, in any case, was more reasonable than hiding from the ceiling or the refrigerator, as he would often suggest to me then, or from the Bible or Shakespeare’s complete works, as I would suggest to him. So we huddled under the table and screamed fake screams of fear — fake because they were whispered imitations of screams, and also because the fear was fake, in theory, though at that moment I did feel fear.
