There is a proliferation of new sources, and one of them, E-Fish, is the outgrowth of a wholesale company that started selling fresh fish from various sources to restaurants last year. “Chefs had to deal with individual fishermen and it was complicated for them, but by aggregating we made it easier,” said Jeff Tedmori, the chief executive and a graduate of MIT’s Sloan School of Management. He came up with the idea with his business partner and the chief operating officer Matthew Henderson, whose family has been in the fish business for generations. Soon after they saw that the fishermen on their roster could not do enough business with so many restaurants closed, they opened for consumer sales. They say most of their products are harvested to order and shipped within a day.
