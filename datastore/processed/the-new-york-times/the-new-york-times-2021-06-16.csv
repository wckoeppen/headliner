The two had met the previous year as entry-level employees at Theo Waddington Gallery on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Though their day jobs were uptown, and they lived in a two-bedroom railroad apartment three blocks away, splitting the rent of $750, the pair shared a disinterest in the art they saw there — Waddington showed Fauvists and Inuit artists, while his neighbors were mainly gentlemanly dealers of old masters, Impressionists and male abstract painters. Pilkington and Olsoff were young, in their mid-20s, but they were also gutsy, no-nonsense and imaginative, and they began to fantasize about opening their own space together. They had traveled to the U.K., in part, to visit Pilkington’s parents, who ran London’s Piccadilly Gallery, which focused on turn-of-the-20th-century European art. But that summer day, as would happen both literally and figuratively at various points in their working relationship, they found themselves stranded at the side of the road. After looking under the car’s hood, Olsoff recalls, Pilkington removed her stockings, as if this were a very normal thing to do, and tied them in place to create a makeshift replacement for the blown-out fan belt. “It worked for just long enough to get to the next garage,” Pilkington recalls. For Olsoff, it was a sign that they would always be able to get by.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
