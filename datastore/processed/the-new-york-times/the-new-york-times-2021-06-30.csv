Baldwin is poised, attentive and beguiling as he speaks to Sylvia Chase, a correspondent for the ABC newsmagazine “20/20.” Across the segment, we see him grinning as he watches a rehearsal of his play “The Amen Corner”; we see him speaking to a group of children in Harlem; we see B-roll of him outside, catching his scarf before it’s swept away by the wind. Toward the end, the writer’s mother, siblings, nieces and nephews gather on a sofa and chairs around him. “There’s a price this republic exacts from any Black man or woman walking,” Baldwin asserts, “and that is a crime.” He reaches for the child seated next to him on the sofa. “They will not do to him,” he says, “what they failed to do to me.” We meet his unblinking gaze as his words resonate. “I was 7 years old 47 years ago,” he says, “and nothing has changed since then.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
