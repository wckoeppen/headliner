His idea is to produce classics like a crisp-skinned croissant with a properly honeycombed interior, but also to disrupt the category. So there is a delicious, flaky multigrain croissant, and one made with olive oil, garlic and rosemary. He’s making a type of brioche scented with orange and star anise, another pastry filled with rice pudding and huckleberry jam, and crunchy gougères oozing Comté cheese.
