She later cut herself off from my brother and me when our children were born, because we refused to cut off all ties with our parents. She believes that my father — who was her stepfather — sexually abused her. While we couldn’t confirm her recovered memories with our own memories, we didn’t deny them. Even if there was horrible behavior like that, and not the more ordinary types of neglect and abuse that we do remember and could confirm, we wouldn’t choose to never see or talk to our parents again. I attended a therapy session with her and was only given this extreme choice. I’m younger, so my memories are those of a small child, and it is important to me to be true to what I do remember.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

Using the heart of the buckwheat seeds, its soba is white, making it more delicate and refined. Yoshinori Horii, who runs the company, decided that New York would be its first overseas branch, but the pandemic stalled the opening. In the warmly decorated New York restaurant, the chef Tsuyoshi Hori (the name is a coincidence) and his staff make the soba that they use. They also make more traditional buckwheat soba using some wheat flour, and diners can select which type of soba they prefer. There are more than a dozen soba dishes, cold and hot, many served with tempura and involving seafood, meats like duck, and vegetables. Several sauce options are also available. In addition, the restaurant offers appetizers like deep fried tofu, grilled eel with eggplant, crab cake, fish carpaccio and a soba roll. Salads, tempura dishes, black cod with miso, sukiyaki, and stone-grilled duck with vegetables are some non-soba items. (Opens Wednesday) ",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
