In a 1973 item about one of Cowley’s books, “Works and Days of the Lost Generation,” William Styron quoted his take on the shape and meaning of a literary legacy: “A generation is no more a matter of dates than it is one of ideology. A new generation does not appear every 30 years. … It appears when writers of the same age join in a common revolt against the fathers and when, in the process of adopting a new lifestyle, they find their own models and spokesmen.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
