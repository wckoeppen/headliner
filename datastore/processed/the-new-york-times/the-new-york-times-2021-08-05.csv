Today, he’s known for immortalizing the work of the 20th-century architect Horace Gifford with his 2013 book, “Fire Island Modernist,” and for his own reimaginings of midcentury styles and spaces — he recently completed a restoration of a late ’60s Harry Bates-designed home in Fire Island Pines. Moving uptown, says Rawlins, would allow him to reconceptualize his life. “I realized I didn’t have to be a cool kid in the Village and that, if I worked out of my home, I could call the shots professionally,” he says. And so he and his then-partner, the artist Tad Mike, purchased two units in the same 1935 cream brick co-op — a 700-square-foot one-bedroom to live in, and a 1,050-square-foot two-bedroom two floors below to use for their studios — and Rawlins launched his own practice.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
