But what about green? A new naturally green salt substitute produced from salicornia, a halophyte, has hit the market. Decades ago, José Ramón Noriega planted salicornia on salt-affected farmland in northern Baja California, Mexico. Now his sons, Paul, Erick and Irving Noriega, and another partner, Chris Lin, are cultivating the crop organically, dehydrating and pulverizing it to make a salty powder they call Green Salt. It’s salty enough to use in place of table salt, though it’s substantially lower in sodium. It adds a nice touch of vegetal flavor when dusted atop a deviled egg, baked potato or sautéed fish. That flavor disappears in cake batter or pasta sauce. While Green Salt is more costly than regular kosher or sea salt, it’s comparable in price to many boutique salts.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
