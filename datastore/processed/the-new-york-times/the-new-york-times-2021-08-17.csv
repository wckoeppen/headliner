The spaces were used in the past by A.I.G. executives for board meetings, private dining and contract-signing ceremonies. They have been converted into this restaurant featuring experiential tasting menus ($245 per person, including tax and a welcome beverage); an elegant, oval cocktail bar called Overstory; and, at the very top, a private dining room. There are a total of 12 terraces with breathtaking views in every direction. Diners will get to see every inch of Saga, including the kitchen, as they are guided from room to room for each course of the executive chef James Kent’s meal. “Menus are conversations,” said Jeff Katz, the general manager and co-owner. “We’re trying to eliminate the standard come-into-the-restaurant, sit-at-the-table and start-the-meal-in-20-minutes format.” Customers need not dine at Saga to belly up to the brass-and-marble bar at the 24-seat Overstory, which is reached by a dramatic flight of stairs.

But it was the unicorn, possessor of what Ctesias described as a cinnabar-red anklebone, that remains his most enduring contribution. (The scholar Chris Lavers, author of 2009’s “The Natural History of Unicorns,” has written that Ctesias assembled the unicorn out of three animals indigenous to the region: the Indian rhinoceros, whose horn is associated with medicinal properties; the goatlike, horned chiru; and the reddish-and-white-colored kiang, a large wild ass.)",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
