When we came back from lunch to our rented whitewashed cool room in someone’s whitewashed cool house on a small whitewashed island — the woman of that house had picked her ripe, jammy figs in the morning and was laying them out on the roof. There they dried in the sun all afternoon, while her husband sat in the shade of the fig trees and mended his fishing nets after the morning’s haul. I’ve since seen people use the sun to dry grapes, fish, mushrooms, herbs, shrimp and lavender. Wherever there is a cobalt blue window frame, there is surely a bushy wreath of vibrant red chiles nailed to it. My mother-in-law Alda, who has since died, used to set large round platters of her tomato purée out on the splintering wicker furniture on her terrace in Santa Maria di Leuca in the south of Italy and let it bake all afternoon under the intense Pugliese sun, from ragù red at noon to dark, leathery ruby by sundown.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
