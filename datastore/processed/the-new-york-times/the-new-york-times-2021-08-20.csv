Embracing the revolution in industrial manufacturing and new materials in Europe, he conceived of the Round D.154.5 chair in 1954. With its contoured, soap bar-shaped back and seat, connected by two arcs of molded plywood, it was covered in two-tone Vipla, an Italian marine vinyl. Ponti referred to it informally as “otto pezzi,” or “eight pieces,” for the number of components used in the deceptively simple design, and featured the hyperfuturistic chair at Alitalia’s Manhattan offices, which opened in 1958. Now, in collaboration with the Ponti archives, the Italian furniture brand Molteni & C has reimagined the work in ash wood and covered in a variety of textiles and leathers, including this terra-cotta-colored linen. Wearing its covert innovations lightly, and still fashioned from a mere otto pezzi, the chair remains as rigorously insurgent as it is supremely comfortable.

By the 1920s, the maison was experimenting with exotic Art Deco creations and, in the early ’30s, it pioneered a groundbreaking new technique called the Mystery Set, by which gemstones could be arranged in a mosaiclike pattern without any visible supports. Its sautoirs, minaudières and brooches quickly became favorites among royals and Hollywood stars including Marlene Dietrich, for whom Van Cleef created one of its most iconic designs, the Jarretière bracelet, in 1937. The story goes that Dietrich gave a handful of her gemstone-studded pieces to Louis Arpels, the brother of Estelle and one of the company’s founders, and asked him to create something special. And so the Jarretière was born: The modernist platinum cuff featured an exaggerated, asymmetrical loop covered in cushion-cut rubies set atop twin bucklelike bands of baguette-and-pavé-set white diamonds. (The piece’s name translates to “garter,” and indeed the design resembles the band worn around the top of a woman’s stocking.) Dietrich famously wore it in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1950 noir thriller, “Stage Fright” (she also insisted on head-to-toe Dior for the role), and to the Academy Awards a year later.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
