Rather, challah rolls with apple filling make suitable stand-ins, and the dough can be used to make one large loaf. The recipe for pletzel, a Polish specialty that’s also called onion board, deserves to be added to your flatbread collection.

In the space that was Leonelli Restaurant and Bar, they’ve pivoted from Italian to French, with the bar, tables and an open kitchen dedicated to bistro fare, and changed the name to Bar Benno. The elegant flagship Benno, which has three stars from The New York Times, in the back of the space will not change, except to feature more seafood when it’s ready for diners in a month or so. But now, fitted with a huge back bar and a U-shaped counter with seating, the new spot, called Bar Benno, will feature a cold seafood selection, and hors d’oeuvres like escargots, egg in a potato crust, pâté de campagne, and Basque-style tripe on its classic menu. Main courses include rotisserie chicken, steak au poivre and bourride, a rich Provençal seafood stew rarely seen on New York menus. Fries will come alongside steamed mussels, a French dip sandwich and steak tartare. From 5 to 7 p.m., with aperitifs and cocktails, there will be savories like deviled eggs with caviar, salmon rillettes, white anchovies with bread and butter, and fried pig’s trotter with sauce gribiche. “I didn’t feel it was enough just to reopen as we were before,” Mr. Benno said. “I’ve been cooking French most of my whole career, so I’m very comfortable with this. Fortunately, we did not have to do a big renovation.” Mr. Benno also said that it was difficult for Leonelli Restaurant and Bar, an Italian taverna, to establish its own personality. But, he said, offering bistro fare in a space that’s something of a prelude to the Benno dining room and that leans toward France made more sense. A taste of Italy with flatbread pizzas, breads and pastries remains available in Leonelli Bakery in the front of the building. (Opens Friday)",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
