In 1996, when Oprah announced the choice on her talk show, she said: “I want to get the whole country reading again. Those of you who haven’t been reading, I think books are important!” She explained how the club would work: Readers who wanted to have dinner with Mitchard could send a letter to a Chicago P.O. box or “write us at America Online, those of us who know how to do that.” The studio audience smiled politely and clapped.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
