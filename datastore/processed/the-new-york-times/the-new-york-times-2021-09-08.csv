Most of these eggs go into a snack she makes for herself when she comes home from work: egg rice. She fries a single egg sunny-side up and places it on a small plate of leftover jasmine rice. Then, over the yolk, she pours a little Maggi sauce, a dark, savory potion of wheat protein. For Dang, who is a pharmacist, there’s a ritual to eating this simple but potent dish, one she has upheld since she was young. She breaks the yolk and mixes the Maggi into it, creating a makeshift gravy that drapes the rice in eggy gold. She pierces her fork straight down into the food, so she has an even distribution of Maggi-tinged yolk, crisp-edged egg white and steamed white rice, fluffy as a fresh-raked pile of leaves, on her tines. “I eat this at least once a day,” she told me.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
