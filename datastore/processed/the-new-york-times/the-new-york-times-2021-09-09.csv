Valle, who creates soft, pared-down interiors and things to fill them, practices a strain of modernism dosed with whimsy — squat, oblong tables with mosaic tiled tops that resemble tortoise shells; stubby tearoom chairs upholstered in nubby chenille that recall the bottom half of a faun; velvet couches the color of tree bark that wind on for longer than would seem strictly necessary, all of which would look at home in a stylish storybook cottage, possibly one tucked within an enchanted forest. So it can be surprising to learn that Valle, 39, trained as an architect, a discipline that demands icy rigor, and worked for a number of years for some of the field’s most influential practitioners, including the firms SHoP and Snøhetta.
