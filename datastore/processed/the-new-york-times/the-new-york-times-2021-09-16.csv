Porter’s novel “Pollyanna.” “The news is that only an unregenerate cynic with an abiding dislike of kids, good or bad, Technicolor and a gentle legend spun in standard, obvious style would rail at this picture-postcard remembrance of improbable things past,” our reviewer wrote. “The blond, pixieish Miss Mills gives a restrained, natural and gratifyingly mature performance.
