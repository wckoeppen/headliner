The New York Times published Marian Burros’s recipe for plum torte (above) in 1983, and did so again every September for six years. Requests for copies of that recipe continued to flood in through the 1990s, but it wasn’t until the birth of New York Times Cooking in the fall of 2014 that we could give it a permanent home. It’s a true taste of the shoulder season between summer and fall, and one of the greatest easy desserts of all time, a perfect Sunday project. Please make it with whatever fruit you can manage today, and raise a glass to Marian when you do. We walk in her footsteps every day.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
