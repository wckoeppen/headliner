For one, it’s in a village, Marston Bigot, that hardly exists except in name (its growth was stymied in part by the 14th-century bubonic plague). And then there is the driveway, the entrance of which is marked only by a rusted iron sculpture, made by Piper’s adult son Henry, that hides in waist-high overgrowth. The property’s integration into the surrounding patchwork of rolling fields and wild hedgerows is exactly what prompted Piper, 83, and her husband, the artist Edward Piper, to move here in 1967.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

It’s a short book that offers a key to some of Beauvoir’s own political engagement and philosophical development, and it’s one of the books we recommend this week.

And a couple of books that might have appealed to Beauvoir herself if she were still on the scene: Randall Kennedy’s essay collection “Say It Loud!
