Like most of her ideas, that purse, dubbed the 2.55 (to commemorate the month and year it was introduced), had feminist underpinnings: The strap allowed women to keep their hands free instead of clutching a handle. In 1983, Karl Lagerfeld, the label’s longtime creative director, subtly updated the 2.55, replacing the simple twist Mademoiselle clasp with interlocking C’s, and would go on to make other modifications. The reinterpreted bag was named the 11.12, evoking the internal style code of Lagerfeld’s medium-size version, the A01112. But while the shape of the purse has remained consistent through the decades, Chanel continues to iterate its embellishments, capitalizing on the house’s small specialist craft ateliers, called Métiers d’art.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
