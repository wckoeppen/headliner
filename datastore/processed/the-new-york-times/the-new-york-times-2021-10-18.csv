One of New York’s first craft distillers, it started with bourbon more than 10 years ago and now it has introduced its longest-aged example, Four Part Harmony, a seven-year-old bourbon made with four grains. (To be labeled bourbon in the United States, the whiskey must be made from at least 51 percent corn and be aged in charred new oak barrels.) This amber whiskey — with a honeyed, hazelnut nose and a mellow richness — combines 60 percent corn, 15 percent each of rye and wheat, and 10 percent malted barley. It’s not the distillery’s first four-grain whiskey, but it’s the oldest, and is a perfect sip on an autumn evening.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
