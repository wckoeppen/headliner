Here, Mexican ingredients and their own corn tortillas will be for sale. To make their tortillas, they are importing more than a dozen varieties of heirloom corn in a rainbow of colors; about 20,000 pounds, in sacks, are stacked throughout the premises. A glassed-in, tortilla-making area is adjacent to the future shop; beyond is the dining room and bar. Mr. Wangeman came from Oaxaca right after high school and studied at the Culinary Institute of America to become a pastry chef, and worked at El Celler de Can Roca in Spain and Per Se in New York. He returned home to deepen his understanding of Mexican cuisine, and later, back in New York, opened pop-ups featuring traditional Mexican ingredients. His wife, a physician whose mother, Carina Santiago Bautista, is the owner and chef of Tierra Antigua near Oaxaca, joined him in the business. Mr. Wangeman said they feature tacos al pastor and that their gringas are made with corn tortillas instead of the more typical wheat but that they use cacahuazintle, an heirloom varietal that is soft and white like wheat flour. There are also side dishes, and the drinks menu focuses on mezcals, tequilas and other Mexican spirits.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
