Fire and firestorms have consumed forests and cities, and from the fall of ashes and soot everything is gray, the river water black.

One might be inclined to assume that Smith, who began writing the book when still a Cambridge undergraduate, has bitten off more than she can chew; one might even feel a little huffy that one so young (she is 24) has aimed so high.

The result is a long prose tale that surveys nearly a century of American history as it impinges upon a single family.

Probably the novel reflects a national tendency. To be sure, after we have carefully separated ourselves from the soil, we are apt to talk a lot about the advantages of a return to it, but in most cases it ends there.

I had the choice of going under or surviving, and I survived by understanding (after the iron — if not the silver — had entered my soul) that it is I who am keeping score.
