Shut out from the New York papers since the calamitous article about the JOUAM parade in the summer of ’92, he had chanced upon the right person in Edward Marshall, and even if the encounter cost him a miserable week in bed, Marshall’s position as Sunday editor of the Press gave him the power to open the door and allow Crane back into the world of journalism. Marshall was just two years older than Crane, and beyond having the wit to recognize talent when he saw it, he was a generational ally who understood what was new and original in Crane’s work. Five days after Crane died at a sanatorium in the Black Forest on June 5, 1900, Marshall wrote a stunned, tight-lipped article for the New York Herald (“Loss of Stephen Crane—A Real Misfortune to All of Us”) that focused mainly on their wartime experiences together in Cuba but also touched on Crane’s first visit to the Potter Building: “One day . . . a young man came to my office with a letter of introduction. He was thin—almost cadaverous. He wanted work and got it. His article—written for a ridiculously low price—on tenement-house fire panics was one of the best things that he or any other man ever did. It was followed by other strikingly strong stories.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
