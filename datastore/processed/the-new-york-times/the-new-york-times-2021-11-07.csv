We picked up an hour of morning sun when Daylight Saving Time came to an end overnight in the United States, and now it’s autumn for real. Time to rake leaves and trim hedges, if you live that sort of life; to store your air-conditioner for the winter; to haul out your sweaters; to set up the Thanksgiving group chat to see who has a new dietary restriction or to determine who’s bringing what to dinner. (First time doing that? We’re here to help.) I’m setting up for 20-plus guests this year, if negative testing allows it.
