At the top of that list was Hayao Miyazaki, the greatest animator in history and the creator of films so singular, so strange, so visually arresting, that to watch them is to be in some way imprinted by them: Years later, one remembers scenes and images from them with an uncanny clarity, the way one might recall scenes and images from one’s own life.

And this seems not just a narrative motif but a reflection of what the viewer herself experiences — one emerges from his films a different person. He is, simply, a sorcerer.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
