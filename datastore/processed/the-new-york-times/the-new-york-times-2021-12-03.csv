It was founded in 1969 by His Eminence Archbishop Franzo W. King, D.D., and his wife, the Most Rev. Supreme Mother Marina King, before they possessed such lofty titles. (Their daughter, the Rev. Chaplain Wanika Stephens, Archpriest, M.A., is also a pastor there.) The church began around 1964, as the Jazz Club in the couple’s garage — “a listening clinic,” F.W. King, now 77, says on a recent Zoom call with his wife, 75, from their home in San Francisco’s Bayview-Hunters Point. (Their daughter, 57, also joined.) “Maybe less than a dozen brothers and sisters would come together every week. Everybody would bring a new album. We’d put the music on and start testing our ears and our knowledge,” seeing if they could name the drummer or the piano player on a track without looking at the record sleeve. One day, someone brought Coltrane’s 1965 record “A Love Supreme,” and King looked at the liner notes, which Coltrane wrote himself. “All Praise be to God to whom all praise is due,” Coltrane begins, and then tells a story: “During the year 1957,” he writes, “I experienced, by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music.” In those years, Coltrane was addicted to heroin and — so the legend goes — while experiencing withdrawals heard the voice of God and got clean, rededicating his life to music.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

In the 80 years since she gave her final performance, “I want to be alone” (a line she spoke in “Grand Hotel”)  has become the thing for which she is best remembered — more than her talent, probably more than her beauty and certainly more than her movies, of which even a lot of cinephiles would have trouble naming five. Her professional legacy is lean: Even the two famous slogans associated with her — “Garbo Talks!” for her first sound picture, “Anna Christie,” and “Garbo Laughs” for her most enduring (let’s just say best), Ernst Lubitsch’s “Ninotchka”  — herald deviations from the norm. This is not the Garbo you know, they say: the silent Garbo, the unsmiling Garbo, the enigmatic Garbo. Impenetrability is an odd quality for a performer to make her signature.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

These vessels are the only residents of this more than 200-year-old traditionally built house, or kominka. A lopsided white one, with gently indented fingerprints mottling its surface like fish scales, rests on the decaying tatami in the large front room. A turnip-shaped pair, one painted with dripping indigo polka dots and the other with a thick belt of sooty brown, seem to gaze out a window together. Hand-formed from grayish-white clay from Japan’s Shiga Prefecture, they are the work of the artist Kazunori Hamana, 51, who uses this once-grand dwelling as an exhibition space. His pieces have been shown at prestigious galleries, including Blum & Poe in Los Angeles and New York, but he refers to them simply as tsubo, a word that suggests utilitarian crocks holding homemade pickles in a grandmother’s kitchen. Compared to these familiar objects, though, Hamana’s tsubo are at once imposing — most measure nearly 30 inches across — and delicate, their weathered and cracked surfaces echoing the crumbling wattle-and-daub walls of their home.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
