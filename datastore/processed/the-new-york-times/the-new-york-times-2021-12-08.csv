He meant a vaccine suitable for all ages that would be at least 75 percent effective for a year or more against Influenza A viruses — the type that causes pandemics but that also, along with Influenza B, annually infects as many as a billion people worldwide and kills somewhere between 290,000 to 650,000 of them. A push to develop such a vaccine began in earnest about a decade earlier and was gaining momentum. “That’s something that I’m spending a lot of time on,” he said. “Also, a lot of scientists are struggling in a positive way to make advances.” It was, he went on, “somewhat embarrassing” that a new and updated flu vaccine had to be made every year. “We really need to do much, much better to get a better vaccine.
