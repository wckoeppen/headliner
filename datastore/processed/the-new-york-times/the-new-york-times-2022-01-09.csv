On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stood by its guidance that Americans who test positive for the coronavirus could end isolation after five days without obtaining a negative test. The omission of a testing requirement has been criticized by some public health experts, and the agency had been widely expected to add testing to its guidelines. Walmart told workers on Tuesday that it would cut its paid time off for workers who contract the virus to one week, down from two.

Macy’s requested the vaccination status of its employees last week, while Starbucks set a Feb. 9 deadline for its U.S. workers to be fully vaccinated and Citigroup said it would dismiss unvaccinated employees by the end of the month.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
