The textile, created from a blend of strong but elastic fibers, is both quick-drying and chlorine-resistant, making it uniquely versatile. “Everything is designed to be used as swimwear, sportswear, underwear or shapewear,” Laub says. “The fabric allows for powerful fits that provide support without a traditional under-wiring structure.” Sustainability is also at the forefront of her vision: Each collection is made in Italy using 3-D knitting techniques that create less waste. Furthermore, clothes that serve multiple purposes, says Laub, encourage shoppers to “buy better and buy less.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
