The most recent hotel addition, Hoshino Resorts’ KAI Poroto, which opened last month, is located on Hokkaido’s southwestern coast near the new Upopoy National Ainu Museum and Park. Guests of the ryokan hotel — which consists of 42 rooms that each look out onto Lake Poroto (poroto ko means “big lake” in the Ainu language) — can spend the day immersing themselves in Hokkaido’s Indigenous history through the museum’s various exhibitions, before returning to the resort for a dip at either of the two bathhouses — one of which features a ketunni (or “tripod-frame”) design — with their alkaline waters rich in humic and fulvic acids. For travelers hoping for a sportier trip, head northwest a couple of hours to Niseko and book a stay at Raku Suisan, an intimate ryokan at the foot of four of the town’s famed ski resorts. With views of Mount Yotei and Mount Annupuri, each of the hotel’s 18 rooms offers a private open-air hot-spring bath.

We see why when he leaves the organ and heads out into the studio audience with his sister Rose: After her solo, he performs a dance routine drawn from Africa, patting juba. “We look like we just landed in a spaceship from Venus,” the group’s original drummer, Greg Errico, tells me of the clip.
