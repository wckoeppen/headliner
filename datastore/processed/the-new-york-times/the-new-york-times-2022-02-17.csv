This week the dish that isn’t quite like the others — thriller, mystery, memoir or biography, and so forth — is Jennifer Raff’s “Origin,” which our reviewer described as a “masterly retelling of the story of how, and when, people reached the Americas.” Raff, an anthropological geneticist at the University of Kansas, writes in her introduction, “Looking at the genetic evidence, we will examine the ways in which DNA has challenged and changed our understanding of Native American history, with a special focus on the events that are only indirectly understandable with the archaeological record.” Her approach will be accessible to the pickiest readers, layering personal anecdotes with a visit to a gene-sequencing lab, heavy on compassion and light on jargon. A Goodreads reviewer put it like this about Raff: “As a young mother she can’t help but impart some poignancy in her accounts of those burial sites where toddlers are interred. In doing so she highlights — as she does throughout the book — the humanity of the person whose remains are the subject of research.” “Origin” is Raff’s first book, and it lands on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
