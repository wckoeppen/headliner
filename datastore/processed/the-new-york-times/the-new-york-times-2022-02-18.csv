Three years later, Webb left the South to make a name for himself in Manhattan, where the brand was officially established in 1948 with a shop on West 46th Street. By the late ’50s, Webb, who collected children’s books on wild beasts and made weekly pilgrimages to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to study Scythian and ancient Egyptian gold artifacts, had become best known for his enameled animal pieces. Banishing barnyard and household creatures from his jewels, the designer, who died in 1975 at the age of 50, favored a far more exotic and mythical menagerie of big cats, zebras, frogs and more. His creations — from compacts shaped like tortoises to carved coral bracelets inspired by the Hindu makara sea dragon — were coveted by the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Diana Vreeland and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and were, as one society reporter wrote, “as essential as the food and drink at La Grenouille to the fashion society clan.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
