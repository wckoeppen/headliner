With that shift—and the massive and ever-swelling bureaucracy that came with it—the presidency had changed too; what for much of America’s first two centuries had been the office tasked with executing policy and spending money decided and set by Congress had seen that power dynamic reverse and instead now piloted the national agenda itself. It was a job now far too big for one man, even as the White House absorbed, stole, and agglomerated still more power and personnel. To Nixon, figuring out how to staff the oversized presidency—whom to trust, how to inspire them and manage them—consumed far too much energy. “It would be god damn easy to run this office if you didn’t have to deal with people,” he lamented.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

The Westminster Gazette says such a service would be unique in the annals of the City Cathedral. “Meanwhile,” writes a representative of that paper who has been making inquiries, “it would be injudicious to assume the accuracy of the foregoing statement, seeing that nothing has, as yet, been decided on the subject whatever, and so far as the Cathedral authorities are concerned, at all events, it is very doubtful whether they would lend their approval to any such scheme as that foreshadowed, the objections to which, it is urged, are many and serious.
