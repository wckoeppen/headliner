The shorter blade is slightly more curved at the tip and the shape borrows aspects of a Japanese santoku, so it’s wider than a Western chef knife, a useful feature. Eytan Zias and Ron Khormaei, who founded the company in 2020, said they “do not make any shapes which are classically French, Japanese or German, but rather design the knives in a practical way that makes sense to us and are most effective for the user.” They also point out that the United States does not have the defined traditions of other countries known for cutlery, so it’s easier to innovate. The knife sharpens easily, has a dark patina, a deep bolster and a beautiful if somewhat heavy handle of Oregon big leaf maple burl. It has heirloom written all over it.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
