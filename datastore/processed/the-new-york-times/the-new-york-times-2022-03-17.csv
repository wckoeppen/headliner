Chaos! Pandemonium! It’s not much fun to live through, but in hindsight it can make for pretty good copy — so it’s not surprising to find, at the center of this week’s recommended titles, that the center doesn’t hold. NoViolet Bulawayo’s new novel, “Glory,” is all about political turmoil. Yoko Tawada’s latest, “Scattered All Over the Earth,” is about climate apocalypse. Two new biographies of Buster Keaton make the case that he was not only a comic genius but also a technological disrupter, madly innovating new directions for the film industry in its early days. And in “Origin,” Jennifer Raff sets out to overturn some long-held theories about the first humans to populate the Americas. Things fall apart. That’s the message of “The Quiet Before,” by Gal Beckerman (until recently my colleague at the Book Review), about social movements building from the ground up, and it’s the premise (in a very different way) of “The Old Woman With the Knife,” Gu Byeong-mo’s novel about a 65-year-old female assassin in Seoul. Meanwhile, disruption of another sort — aesthetic, existential — is at the core of the Swedish writer Jon Fosse’s seven-novel series “Septology,” about an aging painter arguing with God. Happy reading.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
