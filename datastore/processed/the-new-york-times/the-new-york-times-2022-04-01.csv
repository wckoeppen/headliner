In July, the Cannes Film Festival awarded Jones its top male thespian prize for his portrayal of a mass shooter in the Australian drama “Nitram” (now in theaters and on digital). The 32-year-old actor had been to Cannes twice before and had experienced its queasy jitters, spurred by drinking too much, sleeping too little and feeling eyeballs scan his face to gauge his importance. (“L.A., but times 50,” he said.) But this time, all eyeballs were fixed on him as he clutched the awards podium like a fainting chaise. “I think I’m going to throw up,” he sputtered. The audience tittered, uncertain if his panic was a bit. Then Jones fled the stage, leaving in his wake a few exhalations that lingered like dust clouds from a cartoon roadrunner: “I am so sorry — I cannot do this. Thank you so much.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
