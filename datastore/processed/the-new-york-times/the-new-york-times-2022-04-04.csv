The company, based in Great Neck, N.Y, has been in development for several years. After some trial runs last year, it began shipping nationally this year. Some of the Star-K certified beef is U.S.D.A. Prime grade. The company’s founder, Elliot Moskowitz, a financier, saw that for kosher meat there was no equivalent to high-end companies like Snake River Farms or Pat LaFrieda selling directly to consumers. So he stepped in. The prime tomahawk steak ($130), once seared, then finished in a slow oven, was quite tender and had rich flavor. At around 40 ounces, it serves two to four. The choice grade tomahawk is $100. There are also short ribs, rib steaks and roasts, prime or choice, as well as lamb and veal. The meats are shipped frozen. ",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
