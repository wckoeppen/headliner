But in the current climate, the impact of the higher rates is uncertain. During the pandemic, many people, with extra savings in their pockets and in search of more space, bid up house prices. That, combined with supply chain problems that slowed construction of new homes, stoked competition and made new houses hard to come by. The inventory of homes for sale remains extremely low, and there are still more interested buyers than there are houses. But if the market doesn’t feel the sting, prospective home buyers certainly will, especially those who are already struggling with the rising costs of food, gas, cars and other everyday necessities.
