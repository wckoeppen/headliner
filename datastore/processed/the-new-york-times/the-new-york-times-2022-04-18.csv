Rumor had it that celebrities and fashion influencers were paying someone to select reading material for them to carry in public. (Whether they read it was another thing, and, to echo a sentiment shared by a pair of withering college-student characters on the HBO satire “The White Lotus” (2021), beside the point.) In paparazzi photos or on their own social media accounts, these props, because that’s essentially what they were, communicated something far more powerful than a press statement ever could. Today, when entertainers are required to have an immediate, uncontroversial and neatly packaged response to every newsworthy occurrence — when their personal brand is expected to, as Walt Whitman once wrote, contain multitudes — a picture of a book is worth a thousand words. But when Turhan, 34, asked for the name of this mysterious figure, his contacts got cagey. “They acted like they had never heard of such a thing, as if we hadn’t just discussed it,” he recalls.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
