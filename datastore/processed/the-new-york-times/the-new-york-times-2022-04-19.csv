The made-for-TV epic “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,” also based on a novel, took us through a sweep of history from slavery to segregation. The “Roots” mini-series, watched by millions (all at the same time, in a way that’s probably hard to imagine for those too young to remember life before D.V.R.s), portrayed the trans-Atlantic slave trade and plantation barbarity in a way American audiences hadn’t seen. As Charlayne Hunter-Gault reported for The Times in 1977, a Black economist in Philadelphia said, “It has made the brutality of slavery more vivid for me than anything I’ve seen or read.” To refresh a sense of what an event “Roots” was at the time, recall that the cast included some of the biggest names of the day, including John Amos, Lloyd Bridges and Sandy Duncan. Cicely Tyson, who passed away last year, starred in “Sounder,” “Miss Jane Pittman” and “Roots.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

Researchers, the study noted, are increasingly using magnetic resonance imaging — which can reveal the brain’s structure and activity — to try to find links between what is seen on an M.R.I., like cortical thickness or patterns of connection, and complicated psychological traits, like cognitive ability or mental-health conditions. In theory, such so-called brain-wide association studies could yield incredibly valuable insights. Knowing that a particular neurological feature makes someone more vulnerable to autism, Alzheimer’s or another disorder, for example, could help predict, prevent or treat that condition. Likewise, if we can link certain features to desirable traits, like academic achievement, it might be possible to take advantage of that knowledge.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

Appetites are vigorously satisfied; creature comforts less so. In New York, there are touches of luxury in the generous space that housed Bobby Flay’s Gato, with dramatic lighting and a glittering sweep of brass mesh to set off the lounge area. Alan Omsky and Jordan Sayfie, the founders, have joined with an English hospitality company, Reuben Brothers, for this expansion of the brand. (There’s already an offshoot in Mexico City, and other locations are in the pipeline.) Its signature is Japanese yakiniku grilling, which will be handled in an open kitchen with a chef’s table by Chris Arellanes, who worked at Per Se and Eleven Madison Park. Smoked Wagyu brisket, whole roasted cauliflower, six-hour smoked short ribs and a towering coconut cake are coming to New York, along with a newly conceived wood-fired bass with fermented brussels sprouts and dashi, and charred sunchokes with Parmesan cream and togarashi lime.
