It has a recurring image of a bird that’s a figure for death and grief after the loss of the poet’s father. Don Mee Choi’s translation of the poem captures the eternal void of grief. Repetition mimics grief’s insistence: “Bird cuts me out” in the first and third stanzas, “I exit” throughout and “I take a step toward where I don’t exist,” which is repeated twice near the end of the poem. The poem’s form shows how grief changes within stasis. The second and fourth stanzas echo but swerve, until we get the callback and negation in the final stanza: “Bird doesn’t cut me out.” The final line, “Behind the wall I’m on standby forever,” channels the energy of a lyric poem, a sense of running in place.
