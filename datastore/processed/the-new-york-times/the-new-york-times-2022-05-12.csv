An intrepid chronicler of sundry experiences, she’s written about an elite, shotgun-ish wedding (“Seating Arrangements”), a former ballerina who once helped a Soviet dancer defect (“Astonish Me”) and the kindred souls of a plucky 20th-century aviator and the movie star who portrays her (“Great Circle”).

Running the gamut between parodic faux-autofiction and historical fiction narrated by a bevy of marooned, increasingly dissolute Frenchwomen, the stories here are almost studiously varied. They were written over 10 years, during which Shipstead received an M.F.A. from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, popped over to Stanford University as a Stegner fellow and wrote three other books as well as occasional features for magazines including Condé Nast Traveler, Travel + Leisure and Departures.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
