And while not widespread (yet), human cloning has become a reality. Because he has a terminal illness, Cameron (Mahershala Ali, effortlessly carrying the movie) decides to secretly replace himself with a duplicate so that his wife (Naomie Harris) and their young son will be spared the grief of his death. Cameron elopes to a secluded facility run by Dr. Scott (Glenn Close), where his consciousness is uploaded into a “molecularly regenerated” copy of his body. But then Cameron finds it hard to let go: Cameron 2 is himself — only one small mole differentiates them — and yet he is not, provoking complex feelings of fear, jealousy and defensiveness. One of the few people who understands the predicament is Kate (Awkwafina), a dying woman spending her last days at Dr. Scott’s compound after having been replaced in the outside world by a clone. Bathed in the cold palette and cool details (these characters listen to music on vinyl, of course) that are de rigueur for this type of arty sci-fi, “Swan Song” does get a little mopey, but it is also insightful about the difficulty of making huge decisions.
