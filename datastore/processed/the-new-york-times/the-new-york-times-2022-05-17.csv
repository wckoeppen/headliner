You’re unlikely to want to use a whistle indoors. Outside, though — when hunting, herding sheep or even just hiking — your voice can get lost, particularly if the wind is at your face and your dog is off leash ahead of you. A whistle acts like a megaphone, stretching the range of your communication many times beyond the natural confines of your vocal cords.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

This chain of simple, bright spaces with a refrigerated wall holding prepared foods has 27 outlets in Southern California. Mr. Polk says there will be 60 by the end of the year. He plans to expand throughout California and on the East Coast, where he is about to open stores in New York, one in the East Village and two in Chelsea. From the start, his pricing has been flexible, changing according to the median household income in a particular ZIP code. (A serving of carnitas tacos will be $5.75 in the East Village and $7.75 in Chelsea.) As in the California locations, the food for New York is cooked and packaged in a central kitchen as portions for one person and with a four-day shelf life; preparation is done in the former Pfizer industrial building in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn. “Healthy food is more expensive than fast food, but a central kitchen drives down the cost,” Mr. Polk said. “We are still profitable even at the lower price point in some neighborhoods.” The company also has its own delivery team, and there are plans for two locations in Harlem, one near City Hall, one in the financial district and another in Flatbush, Brooklyn.
