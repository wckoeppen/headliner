So he moved to Albany, N.Y., started catering and considered opening a restaurant. “It’s something I thought I could do,” he said. Now, at age 34, he is a restaurateur, specializing in Cajun and Creole cooking. He enrolled in an online hospitality business program through Cornell University, found advisers and a business partner, and then, because of Covid, was able to pick up a restaurant space at a reasonable rent. His sliver of a restaurant in TriBeCa is named for filé powder, the ground sassafras thickener often used for making gumbo. But he’s from Boise, Idaho, not the Bayou. He said he grew up eating Louisiana fare, which his maternal grandfather, Aubrey Gaines, known as Tiny, would cook at home. (Though he wasn’t a Louisiana native, Mr. Gaines learned the cuisine in his travels with a construction company.) Mr. McCree’s gumbos, including Tiny’s gumbo based on his grandfather’s style, are cooked to order in kettles behind a counter with a long row of tables opposite. They come with a choice of chicken and andouille sausage; seafood; all the above; and vegetarian. Traditional fare like jambalaya, crayfish étouffée, grilled oysters, shrimp Creole, blackened fish and, at lunch, muffuletta and po’ boy sandwiches, are also served.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
