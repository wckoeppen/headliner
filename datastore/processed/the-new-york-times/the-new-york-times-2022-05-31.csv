With Crown Shy, Harry’s, Nobu Downtown, Temple Court, the new Le Gratin and this gracious restaurant and bar by John Fraser in the Wall Street Hotel, it’s heading in that direction again. The hotel, owned by Paspaley, a major pearl company in Australia, is in a repurposed office building with a mercantile past. (The restaurant’s name — “the merchant” in French — reflects that.) An elegant bar leads to a white-tablecloth dining room with an elaborate raw bar and a couple of semiprivate tables framed in heavy drapes. Despite the formality of the setting, Mr. Fraser hopes to attract what he sees as a younger crowd who live and work in the area, by modernizing the French fare that shaped his career in Paris. “I’m looking at the 21st century, using global ingredients, sometimes out of left field,” he said. He’s supported by his executive chef, Rick Horiike, who worked at Buddakan and Wild Ink. Among the raw-bar items and appetizers on the lengthy menu are beef tartare, asparagus or blue crab enclosed in rice paper rolls; littleneck clams with cilantro mignonette; and lightly seared duck breast, sliced carpaccio-thin, with a drizzle of fish sauce caramel. Main courses include sweet rice with mushrooms cooked in a banana leaf, a version of homard à l’Américaine made with coconut milk, coffee-crusted pork chop with lentils, trout baked with a basting of miso, and roasted or steamed Dover sole for two with vermouth-lime butter. Desserts include a floating island with Japanese-style cheesecake. Amy Racine, the beverage director for Mr. Fraser’s JF Restaurants, will oversee the 120-label wine list that, while mostly French, lists some Australian selections to honor the hotel’s owners.

Now Oishii has just opened a major new indoor vertical farm in a former Anheuser-Busch plant in Jersey City, N.J., and the increased production is allowing the company to reduce prices by about half, so a tray of 11 delicious medium-size Omakase Berries is now $20, or six for $11. The Whole Foods in NoMad, 63 Madison Avenue (28th Street), which opens this week, is selling them, as are a number of the city’s high-end food retailers.
