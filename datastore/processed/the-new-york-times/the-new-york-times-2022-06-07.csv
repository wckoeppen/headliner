The typical herd ranged in size from the dozens to the low hundreds. During the 1980s, cheap, federally subsidized grain, an absence of antitrust enforcement, the rise of huge meatpacking companies, and new production techniques devised by those companies turned hogs into industrial commodities — and drove 80 to 90 percent of American hog farmers out of the business.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

As Paula Byrne points out in her capacious biography, Pym’s annus horribilis was the same 1963 Larkin satirized in his poem “Annus Mirabilis,” as the year sex “began” in the U.K., bookended by “the end of the Chatterley ban” — when the courts ruled Lawrence’s famous novel non-obscene and freely publishable — “And the Beatles’ first LP.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
