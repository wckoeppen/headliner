For Kitty Tait, a teenager who overcame clinical depression by baking, it led to a successful bakery, the Orange Bakery in Watlington, England, near Oxford, and a book. At 14, Ms. Tait’s formerly sunny outlook was plunging into despair.

The story of Kitty’s recovery and the challenges of opening the business is told by each of them, in alternating segments. It’s an honest, lively read. Recipes for yeast breads, sourdough loaves, earthy soda bread, buns, croissants, crackers, custard tarts, and cookies, including fine brown butter chocolate chip, fill about half the book.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
