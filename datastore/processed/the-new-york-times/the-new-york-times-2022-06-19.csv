While taking questions from reporters after the announcement, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said officials were “not trying to induce a recession right now.” Nonetheless, that’s what many fear: If the Fed’s efforts to tame rising prices and tamp down demand go too far, the bank could touch off a serious economic slowdown, forcing businesses to close and sending unemployment numbers back up. And the Fed has shown no signs of changing its path. The increase on Wednesday could be followed by a similarly large one next month. Mr. Powell is likely to face tough questions about this and other Fed actions when he appears before lawmakers in the House and Senate this week.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
