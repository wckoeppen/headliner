Though it retains the general contours of its predecessor, it’s more plush and richly upholstered, in deep browns with bright accents. In the evenings, there is live music, including singing from a new balcony stage over the bar, now relocated to a more central position. “It has a combination of luxury elements; it’s built for celebratory moments,” said Jeff Katz, who owns Al Coro with the chef, Melissa Rodriguez.  (She is also the chef and a partner at Mel’s.) Mr. Katz and James Kent, his business partner, recently divided their holdings amicably: Mr. Katz now runs Al Coro and Mel’s, the pizzeria next door, and Mr. Kent is in charge of the Lower Manhattan properties Crown Shy, Saga and Overstory. Mr. Kent said the split made sense from a geographical standpoint. Ms. Rodriguez, who started at Del Posto over 10 years ago and became the executive chef in 2017, described the food as regional Italian. But her tasting dinners ($195 for five courses, $245 for seven), which are detailed by the servers, not printed, involve Italy sporadically. Gremolata and lardo adorn green and white asparagus; frico tops vegetable giardiniera; and a pasta course features culurgiones, a type of dumpling filled with potato, Fontina and mascarpone, with a caviar butter sauce and razor clams. A main course might be a whole roasted sea bass with Marsala and mushrooms, chicken breast done in the style of Peking duck or both on the seven-course menu. Many courses include a collection of savory condiments. The plan is for the menus to be sent to diners the day after their visit, and Ms. Rodriguez plans to change the lineup monthly. There will be a cocktail bar on the spacious lower level. (Opens Wednesday)",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
