The second line is a near replica of the first, sharing most of the same words but rejiggered syntactically so that the tone of the line changes. The minute readers try to grasp onto traditional notions of subject matter, the poem swerves linguistically, forcing us to find meaning in the substance of sound, of movement. The poem itself is a representation of motion rather than meaning, and of the cycles of life where things happen in constant loops of living and tears.

McConnell’s justification was his deep commitment to small-d democracy: No seat should be filled in a presidential election year; the people should be given a chance to weigh in.
