Almost all the sailors experience a deep unease, “a sense of blasphemy,” at the act of capture: “So close, she was terrifying, a person there, no doubt about it; a trapped and dying woman.” The mermaid, Aycayia — huge, wounded, furious, utterly vulnerable, “crawling with sea-lice” — brings out powerful impulses in the men: to harm, to possess, to touch, to mark her, despite or even because of the hatred in her “tinfoil eyes.” This violent, mesmerizing scene begins “The Mermaid of Black Conch,” signaling the book’s ambition. Monique Roffey’s sixth novel is a fairy tale: The mermaid casts off her tail, regains her legs, falls in love, battles an ancient curse. But it is a ghost story too, the people and the very land of Black Conch haunted by the island’s legacy of colonialism and enslavement.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
