The poet Agha Shahid Ali introduced the form to America. “Ghazal” literally means “the cry of a gazelle” as it is being chased and about to die. Like many formal poems such as the sonnet, the ghazal, with its restrictions, can paradoxically illuminate and parse difficult emotions. In López’s poem, the emotion is grief — a longing for and memory of a murdered brother. This poem mostly follows the parameters of a ghazal with its repeated end word, “song,” and the inside rhyme of “forever,” “far,” “marred,” etc., as well as the poet’s name or reference to the poet (“Sister”) in the final line. One way this poem breaks the rules is that each couplet doesn’t stand alone as if it were its own poem. Instead, the end of the couplets often bleed into the next stanza, linking the narratives.

But we hold on to the idea that society got “freer” during our generation (whatever that means) because we want our own youthful indiscretions to have “pushed boundaries” (another useless phrase) and “changed the scope of what was possible” (ditto). And while we can usually imagine our own children will take that “freedom” even further, our narcissism forces us to worry that society will crumble as a result.
