Much of the reaction traces to Justice Clarence Thomas, who in his concurring opinion in Dobbs argued that “In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence and Obergefell.” It was a shot across the legal bow that prompted James Obergefell, one of the petitioners in Obergefell v. Hodges — the case that guaranteed same-sex couples a constitutional right to marry — to respond, in an interview on CNN last week, that Thomas had “put a target” on “the right to contraception, the right to intimacy with the person you love and the right to marry the person you love,” and “that should terrify everyone in this nation.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
