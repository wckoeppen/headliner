Mr. Musk’s lawyers said on Friday that Twitter’s request in the suit for an expedited trial in September was unreasonable and asked to delay it.

The two parties could also settle, with Mr. Musk paying damages. Or, if his financing falls through, he could get out of the deal by paying a $1 billion breakup fee.
