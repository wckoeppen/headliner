In a poem called “The First Number Will Be a Blues,” Sommer Browning describes one version of this story: “Before we’re born, my mother tells us, / We watch movies of every life we might be born into. Then we choose. / The little baby points from her / astral cradle.” The speaker marvels at the implications: “I choose that mama. / I choose that daddy. / I choose that irrevocably broken marriage, / That accident that wires my jaw shut, / That burned popcorn” — the litany continues — “That root canal, that unending night on mushrooms, / That dog bite.” “That DUI.” Is it absurd to imagine we select our own pattern of suffering, or that we might have picked a life without any? As Willard Spiegelman notes in his book “Seven Pleasures,” “‘Hap’ means chance.” Happiness and happen share the same root. Whether we choose them or not, the random happenings of our lives, good and bad, are our own. The details that add up to days and years — your street name, your first word, your favorite podcast — have what Ernest Becker might have called a “cosmic specialness.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
