That restaurant closed in February, and he has relocated to East 86th Street, in the former Little Frog. Throughout he was noted for his cuisine, inspired by his native Umbria and Rome, where he trained, long before Roman food achieved its current prominence in New York. He is now joined by his son, Sandro Fioriti Jr., who runs the restaurant, with his father in the kitchen turning out his well-regarded spaghetti al limone, rigatoni amatriciana, cacio e pepe, fried artichokes and pollo cacciatora alla romana. The younger Mr. Fioriti, who has been involved for the past eight years, said that the menu was essentially the same as it was on 81st Street, and that the kitchen and dining room staff also made the move.
