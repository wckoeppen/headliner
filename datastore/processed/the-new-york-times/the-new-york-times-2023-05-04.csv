The vessel was preserved by Athenian citizens, who continually replaced its rotting planks with strong, fresh timber so a pilgrimage to Delos could be made each year in their hero’s name. Fascinated by this mythical tale, the philosopher Plutarch found it to embody a “logical question of things that grow”: After Theseus’s ship had been stripped of all its original material, could it still be considered the same ship? His question has caromed through centuries of Western thought. What if, Thomas Hobbes wondered, someone rustled up a second boat out of the discarded planks; would you now have two original vessels?

Wortham calls the book, aptly, “a mosaic that holds the relentless terror of Black life as well as its undeniable beauty,” then quotes Sharpe on her aims for the notes she has assembled here: “I wanted them to have a certain kind of force and velocity and accumulation.” (They have exactly that, according to Jennifer Szalai’s thoughtful review, as well as a radical sense of integrity and resistance.)
