The El Bulli Foundation, which replaced his restaurant, is now publishing more than 20 books about many aspects of gastronomy. It’s part of the Bullipedia project, encyclopedic surveys and analyses written by teams of experts. There are eight volumes of intensely‌ detailed books on wine, Bullipedia Wine Sapiens; the first two, “Contextualizaton and Viticulture” and “Vinification and Classifications,” have been translated from Spanish into English — subsidized by Juvé & Camps, a venerable cava producer — and are now available in the United States. “We examined many books on wine, even wine atlases, but found none that took our encyclopedic approach,” Mr. Adrià said. The books are designed for professionals and gastronomes, especially for those who are engaged in and appreciate fine-dining, which Mr. Adrià contends is thriving. With Hubbell precision, the books examine the history, evolution, production, categorization, serving and appreciation of good wine, illustrating the material with close-ups of ripening berries, pruning methods, climate maps, bottling and more in the first two books’ nearly 1,200 pages. Mr. Adrià and Ferran Centelles, the sommelier who covers the beverage side of the project, say they have made discoveries, like the first printed wine list from 1804. It is all, however, seen through a Western lens; the foundation’s definition of fine dining ‌is limited — it does not invite Asian cuisines to the table, for example. “We can only be experts in Western culture,” Mr. Adrià said.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
