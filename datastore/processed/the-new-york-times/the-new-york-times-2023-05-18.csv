The poem begins with light and wind — fixtures of poetry. There’s the lyric sweetness of herons and mountains. Even Chaucer’s zephyr shows up. At its midpoint, however, the poem turns. The sorry state of the poet is revealed. The wind won’t blow, or at least not yet. The poem ceases to fly: Instead it’s grounded in the dusty corner. The diction turns, too, from the poetical to the everyday, nearly antipoetical idioms of “crying my eyes out” and “it’s no picnic.” Sadness has done this, extracted the wildness from both the poet and the poet’s vocabulary. Then the kink in the light returns. (This poem was originally commissioned by United States Artists and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and appeared recently in a slightly different form in Shift Space.) Selected by Anne Boyer",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
