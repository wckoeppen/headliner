Is it because New York’s intimate sushi counters can’t meet the demand? Whatever the reason, the latest example in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, with 18 seats at a black marble counter facing an impressive open kitchen, follows a playbook that’s as French as it is Japanese. The chef and owner, Yuu Shimano, graduated from the Tsuji Culinary Institute in Osaka, Japan, and Lyon, France. He then worked at Guy Savoy in Paris and moved to New York to become the executive chef at Mifune. Mr. Shimano; his chef de cuisine, Shuji Furukawa; and the pastry chef Masaki Takahashi serve an 18-course tasting menu ($250) starting with a smoked trout tartlet with fennel cream, an octopus fritter, and caviar with sour cream on brioche garnished with a shiso flower. After dishes like smoked mackerel confit, a mushroom flan with surf clam and English peas, and fluke and scallop mousse in cabbage with a vin blanc sauce, the finale is his signature duck pie, like a well-burnished duck Wellington with foie gras. Wine and sake or nonalcoholic pairings are options. The restaurant has a couple of plush lounge areas for after-dinner mignardises and digestifs suggested by Akio Matsumoto, the sommelier.

After my father’s winter death, my mother asked for a copy of their answering machine messages — still blinking from when he was alive. Copying the original tape, I overheard them whispering: “Sweetie,” “Darling,” “Dear.” Their promises interspersed with kisses, smacking the air.

Suddenly there is a sound, one we only learn is a helicopter when those loopy goggles alight on it. The lengthy firefight that ensues is mostly just flashes in the darkness with occasional infrared — a beautiful tableau, like a Vija Celmins painting, that feels weird to enjoy only if you look too closely.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
