He liked the geometric simplicity of concentric circles on a square panel but decided to add one flourish: In the blank space designating the record’s label, he wrote, “This Must Be the Place,” and the band responsible for the iconic ’80s song, “Talking Heads.” Today, O’Hara sells custom vinyl paintings about as fast as he can make them through Forsyth, the St. Louis design brand that he co-founded in 2015 (and that also sources vintage furniture pieces and reupholsters them with sumptuous fabrics). Customers choose the size, the color (options include black, red, blue and metallic 24-karat gold leaf) and, of course, the song or album. “There’s a strong emotional quality to them because they’re so personal,” says O’Hara, who, it seems, is not alone in having vivid memories of spinning records in his friends’ basements — the music selections tend to be dad-friendly.
