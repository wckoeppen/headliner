Its Mercer Kitchen is now this spot, in the hands of Scott Sartiano, a hospitality entrepreneur best known for top-shelf places like Zero Bond. This brick-walled basement space became proof that a windowless underground location could be a destination when run by a notable chef like Jean-Georges Vongerichten. Here, Mr. Sartiano has dipped into his family’s legacy from Naples and elsewhere in Italy, alongside Alfred Portale, the culinary director. Mr. Portale will now divide his time between this location and Portale, nearby in Chelsea, and he describes his food as “elevated Italian American classics.” He adds fennel to the fritto misto, makes a broccoli rabe pesto to coat sausage and orecchiette, inserts shavings of black truffle into the mushroom lasagna, enhances savory cannoli with caviar and prepares Dover sole piccata-style. The menu lists several steaks, including a 36-ounce porterhouse of olive-fed Wagyu. (And you thought Wagyu cattle only like beer.) The open kitchen faces part of the dining room, with one communal table and exposed brick walls. The room is richly upholstered, punctuated with mirrored columns. “This space has great legacy,” Mr. Sartiano said.
