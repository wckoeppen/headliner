Vasconcelos’s newest project is her most ambitious yet: “Wedding Cake,” an almost 40-foot-high three-tiered wedding cake pavilion in pastel shades of pink, green and blue, was installed this spring on the grounds of Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire, England. The whimsical creation is clad in 25,000 ceramic tiles (manufactured in Vasconcelos’s native Lisbon) and adorned with ceramic cherubs, dolphins and a water feature. Commissioned by the collector and arts philanthropist Lord Jacob Rothschild, the “impossible project,” as the artist describes it, has been five years in the making and is the culmination of Vasconcelos’s long-held fascination with the dynamics of weddings: “Weddings are the most important moment in some women’s lives,” she says. “It’s the transition from one identity to another. All transition moments are marked by symbols. This is my way of working through these symbols and asking if they still make sense.” “Wedding Cake” opens June 18, waddesdon.org.uk.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

Such deaths were distressingly common, she discovered. The suicide rate among doctors appeared to be even higher than the rate among active military members, a notion that startled Dean, who was then working as an administrator at a U.S. Army medical research center in Maryland. Dean started asking the physicians she knew how they felt about their jobs, and many of them confided that they were struggling. Some complained that they didn’t have enough time to talk to their patients because they were too busy filling out electronic medical records. Others bemoaned having to fight with insurers about whether a person with a serious illness would be preapproved for medication. The doctors Dean surveyed were deeply committed to the medical profession. But many of them were frustrated and unhappy, she sensed, not because they were burned out from working too hard but because the health care system made it so difficult to care for their patients.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
