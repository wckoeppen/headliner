For Sebastian Masuda, a Japanese artist and designer, sushi gives free rein to kawaii, the cutesy component of Japanese culture. On a block that is also home to Flour Shop’s colorful baked goods, his neon-pink sushi restaurant fits right in. Enormous grinning cats dangle from the ceiling, lights look like tubes of lipstick and a sinuous conveyor belt at a 18-seat counter delivers portions of sushi made with tuna and pink rice on savory turquoise macarons; tempura served with a palette of bright dips; and chirashi dappled with beads of salmon roe and piled into a parfait glass. The food on the conveyor is interspersed with Mr. Masuda’s playful, glittering sculptures of sushi and stilettos. Six courses are $85. Table seats are available indoors and out. Mr. Masuda calls it the “new generation of sushi,” as entertaining as it is tasty. The chef, Kyle Puchir, is a Daniel alum. There are also options for takeout, including individual sushi bites wrapped in cellophane like candy. Hiro Nishida, a restaurateur, manages the venture, and Taka Tanaka, whose company Autec makes sushi robots, is a partner. (Opens June 28)",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
