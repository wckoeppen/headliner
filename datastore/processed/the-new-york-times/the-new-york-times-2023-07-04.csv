I hadn’t planned to taste any wine, content to take in the city’s peculiar West Coast weirdness, but a friend who worked for a food magazine said that I had to meet this winemaker who worked like an artist. She might have used the word “genius.” I mentioned Harrison to another friend, who’s in the wine business. He echoed the recommendation, describing her ambiguously as a person who had “declared war on wine.” Everywhere I looked online, Harrison was receiving accolades for the results of an unorthodox approach to winemaking, which drew as much from painting — she has a condition known as synesthesia, in which information meant to stimulate one sense also stimulates others — as it did from traditional notions of taste and aroma. Some critics let on that her wines had the complexity, tension and narrative arc of a great artwork. So I sent Harrison an email and received a response that began unenthusiastically with, “Unfortunately it is well known that I don’t like all that many humans.” She seemed to mean it. Still, she agreed to see me.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
