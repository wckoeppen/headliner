By Florence Fabricant,Skip the Reservation With Carbone’s Jarred Vodka Sauce,"Try the sauce from Major Food Group as well as tomato alla vodka cannellini beans from Heyday Canning, sip a lightly fizzy refreshment from Tepache Sazón, and more food news.",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/17/dining/carbone-vodka-sauce.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/17/multimedia/17Burner-Sauce-hmkj/17Burner-Sauce-hmkj-articleLarge.jpg,2023-07-17T16:40:32+0000,"When Carbone, the high-profile wiseguys restaurant from Major Food Group, introduced its jarred pasta sauces in 2021, missing from the lineup was the restaurant’s signature Alla Vodka. Now it is finally swaggering onto supermarket shelves and online. Eric Skae, the chief executive of Carbone Fine Foods, said the goal was to replicate the restaurant experience, and that took a long time at the stove. For freshness, they wound up omitting the usual cream from the tomato and Calabrian chile mixture. Instructions on the label have you add it at home. Vodka sauce, pink, spicy, packing some heat but rarely tasting of vodka, may have originated in New York or in Italy decades ago; its popularity is undimmed. So much so that earlier this year, Heinz in England introduced its version of vodka sauce in collaboration with Absolut, the vodka company with its name on the label. In the United States, jarred vodka sauces are ubiquitous on supermarket shelves. For a new perspective, there’s now tomato alla vodka cannellini beans from Heyday Canning, a new company with a line of seasoned canned beans to serve as is or to add wherever your imagination takes you. And here, too, they’ve skipped the cream to make it vegan; coconut milk is the stand-in. The luscious cannellini in vodka sauce is excellent tossed with the requisite penne or rigatoni. Also in Heyday’s line are enchilada black beans, apricot-glazed baked beans, coconut curry chickpeas, harissa lemon chickpeas, and kimchi sesame navy beans.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
