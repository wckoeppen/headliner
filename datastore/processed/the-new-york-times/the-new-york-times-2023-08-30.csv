Jesus says in Matthew 19:24: “And I say again unto you — it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.” But across the end of the 20th century, any number of figures built immense and lucrative flocks by coming at that problem from a very different direction: a promise, perhaps, that you might look great crossing into heaven in a camel-hair suit. That this sentiment aligned so well with politically ascendant strains of conservatism may or may not be coincidence, but the net effect was the same. There is the elevation of wealth as a sign of virtue. There is the sense that if only those in need had been more righteous, they, too, might have been blessed. There is, in short, the long, strange trajectory of American temperament that has, on some level, brought us to HBO’s “The Righteous Gemstones.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

The garden in question is “The Giverny Suite” (2019), her densely layered three-channel video installation that will be on view at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, as a new addition to its collection, starting Sept. 1. In one of the suite’s segments, Gary visits Claude Monet’s garden at Giverny, in the Normandy region of France, staging herself as an errant presence within its manufactured perfection; as she roams the grounds, she suddenly disappears amid precisely arranged trees, and abruptly starts screaming by the water lily pond, inserting glitches into the image. Elsewhere in the suite, Gary treats a street corner in Harlem like its own discrete ecosystem, paying close attention to how Black women inhabit the space. “The Giverny Suite,” much like her practice in general, traverses geographies and histories while employing an array of experimental techniques. Yet the installation also coheres around a singular vision — one of autonomy and safety for Black women.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
