The word “landscape,” for instance, originally meant a painting, and only later also the land itself. In a similar way, “tragedy” originated onstage, as a dramatic form, before acquiring the more general meaning of a devastating or unfortunate situation. What we now think of as Greek tragedy is a relatively small corpus from the fifth century B.C., fewer than three dozen plays from the hundreds that were produced over the course of that century. Among the tragedians, there are extant works from only three: Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. Their plays premiered at the annual City Dionysia, a festival that was held on the slopes of the Acropolis each spring, drawing large audiences. Some of the features of those premieres might seem strange to us now: Each dramatist presented four plays at a time, in competition; the performances took place outdoors in daylight; the actors wore masks of fixed expression; and, with the exception of the chorus, the roles in any given play were performed by no more than three actors, all male. Theatrical conventions have changed since then. But the plays still reach us with their clarity, nobility and wisdom. When I flew to Athens last summer, it was to fulfill a dream of seeing Greek tragedy performed in Greece. I hoped to come closer to the strange power of these works.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
