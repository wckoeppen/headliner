But the ground floor restaurant and shop, a combination salumeria, grocery, delicacies market, wine bar and cafe, compressing much of the Roscioli experience into one room, is about to open. Pale wood counters for dining, and shelves holding all sorts of goods fill the 40-seat room. Alessandro Pepe, a partner in the Roscioli company, is running the New York venture with Ariel Arce, who originally owned Niche Niche in the space. He said Roscioli prides itself on stocking preserved vegetables, olive oils, cheeses, condiments and cured meats from small producers. New York’s outpost will carry both imported and local products, pared down from the hundreds of choices in Rome. The wine bar menu of small plates, pastas, meatballs, supplì alla Romana and focaccia, features many of these products, some of which, with respect to low carbon footprint, arrive from Europe by sailboat. The chefs are Tommaso Fratini from Rome, and Aaron Lirette, who was at Niche Niche. Kenneth Crum, also from Niche Niche, is working with Mr. Pepe and Ms. Arce in developing the wine list.
