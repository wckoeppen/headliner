Paul Morris, a fellow dealer who knew she was restless, suggested that they open galleries in Chelsea. “Why would I move to Chelsea?” Hearn recalled thinking. The formerly industrial neighborhood was a better place to get an oil change than to see an exhibition. SoHo was the undisputed heart of the downtown art world. But Hearn was intrigued, and she spent the next day with Morris visiting warehouses near the Hudson River. The installation artist Tom Burr, who showed with Hearn’s partner, Colin de Land, recalled her bursting into a restaurant sometime later and describing the new space she’d found: a former garage on West 22nd Street.

It’s a testament to Hewson’s extraordinary charisma that her character can openly wish Max would get kidnapped and we root for her anyway.

After years of high-profile jobs at places like Manhattan’s Acme and Shou Sugi Ban House in the Hamptons, Refslund, a co-founder of Noma, wanted a permanent space where he could create an immersive culinary experience. The open kitchen, and its live fire grill, is at the center of the 4,800-square foot room on Green Street. The space has 17-foot ceilings with wooden beams and exposed brick walls; custom rosewood tables and leather banquettes frame the perimeter (though a few counter seats provide the best vantage of a meal coming together). “This is about transparency,” Refslund says. The name Ilis is a portmanteau of sorts, with ild meaning “fire” in Danish and is meaning “ice.” It’s a nod to the dichotomous spirit of the restaurant — serious cooking with laid-back dinner party vibes. The menu allows guests to choose from a selection of primary ingredients, say New England scallops or Pennsylvania wild duck, and, in some cases, style of preparation (raw or grilled, for example). The seasonal cuisine is informed by Refslund’s Scandinavian upbringing, as well as his travels to Japan and Mexico City. But, the chef says, “hopefully, it will just become a New York restaurant,” a reflection of the city he now calls home. Ilis opens on Oct. 11, ilisnyc.com.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
