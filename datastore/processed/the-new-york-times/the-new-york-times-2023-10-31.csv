Now, having reached cruising altitude after 30 years at the stove in New York, a city where his family has roots, he’s finally putting his name on a restaurant. It’s in a first-class building, formerly a bank and now a hotel, designed by McKim, Mead & White and offering a spacious dining room at double height with an open kitchen on one side, a plethora of detailed finishes in wood, and mirrors and bronze throughout. It’s a gracious setting — “tablecloths are back,” he said. Wine-friendly, French-Italian dishes include Wagyu carpaccio; veal tongue Castelluccio (with lentils); crab and Meyer lemon salad; lobster cannelloni with caviar; sole Normande; black bass with truffle zabaglione; squab en croûte; and scallops Cardoz that pay homage to Floyd Cardoz, known for his interpretations of Indian food. Mr. Carmellini plans to spend most of his time at this new flagship working with his chef de cuisine, Kyle Goldstein. The pastry chef, Jeffrey Wurtz, has a diverse repertoire, including sticky toffee pudding, olive oil cake with Sorrento lemon, and passion fruit chiboust with coconut sorbet. The wine cellar, overseen by Josh Nadel from NoHo Hospitality Group, Mr. Carmellini’s company that’s also running the food and drink for the hotel, has some 1,800 labels. There will be three sommeliers on duty. (Opens Thursday)",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
