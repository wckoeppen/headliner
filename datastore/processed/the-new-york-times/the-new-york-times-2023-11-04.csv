Williams’s second crossword for The New York Times, after an August debut that also ran on a Saturday. As Mr. Williams promised, both puzzles have identical grid patterns, and this seems to be the second installment of a series inspired by Wallace Stevens’s poem “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird.” Who doesn’t like a touch of suspense with their solve? Only one comment on the Wordplay post for the August grid mentioned a Stevens reference, but it didn’t elucidate, and I don’t see a connection between the poem and either puzzle. It might be hidden in the geometry of the puzzle itself, since that’s a constant, or in the crosshatch of entries in its center.
