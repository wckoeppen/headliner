Easily slotted into a stocking or attached to a larger gift (a backyard pizza oven, say, or a spice drawer organizer), chile flakes are another one of those kitchen staples that can be noticeably improved when done thoughtfully. Pizza Marvin, a Providence, R.I., pie shop that combines a nostalgic neighborhood feel with careful attention to ingredients, makes its own fragrant mix using locally grown peppers. The Athens-based herb purveyor Daphnis and Chloe sells a jar of flakes made out of Karatzova peppers that have been smoked for 10 days before being crushed by hand. For a variation on the theme, try Sambal Goreng chile topping, a mix of fried shallots, garlic and chiles made by the Los Angeles-based sisters who started the Balinese food pop-up Bungkus Bagus. (If your recipient becomes obsessed, next year you can give them a bulk jar.) And while Fly by Jing’s Sichuan chile crisp is a reliable source of heat and flavor, the brand’s recently released Chengdu Crunch adds texture to the equation with pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and fava beans.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
