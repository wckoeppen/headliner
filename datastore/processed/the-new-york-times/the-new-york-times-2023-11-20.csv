He devotes an entire chapter to creamed onions, essential at Thanksgiving dinner when I was growing up. His book has recipes for them dated to 1665 and a reference to the 1941 film “They Died With Their Boots On,” in which the onions play a role alongside Errol Flynn. Other discussions of onion cookery — as in soup, stuffed, fried, breads, pickled, with eggs, in sandwiches (famously by James Beard) and more, with recipe histories — follow an unraveling of the onion botanically, historically, medicinally, literally, economically and gastronomically around the world. Despite relevant but overlong digressions on the origins of the Gibson and of the bagel, it’s a lively read. On the culinary side he might have touched on the Spanish tortilla when discussing eggs and onions; he makes an interesting point about swapping cream for milk when using older recipes.
