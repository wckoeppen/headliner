Next door to Silver Apricot she has opened this new spot, in the brick-walled premises that previously housed the beloved Pearl Oyster Bar. “So far the two restaurants seem to reinforce each other,” Ms. Zhao said. “We’ve had people come here for a drink and a snack, because Silver Apricot doesn’t have a bar, and then have dinner at Silver Apricot.” The Chinese American approach, intended to express something of the immigrant experience, is given a narrower frame than at Silver Apricot, with emphasis on the Southern Atlantic region where Ms. Zhao, a North Carolina native, was raised. So you’ll find turnip tots with lap cheong mayo and shrimp ketchup; shrimp cocktail with Chinese horseradish; Hong Shao collard greens with pork belly and Thai chile; grilled branzino; soy-poached chicken with collard greens and crispy hoppin’ John; and hot fried skate with chile crisp, buttermilk ranch dressing and sesame biscuits. Like its sibling, the tables are not set with chopsticks but they can be requested. The executive chef, Calvin Hwang, who grew up in New Jersey, worked at Crown Shy and Saga. The pastry chef, Janice Sung, was at Saga and One White Street; among her creations is a banana custard pie seasoned with Chinese five-spice. The restaurant has three areas. At the entrance is a 12-seat bar with a standing rail and a jazzy dragon splashed across the wall. The main dining room is done mostly in blue and white in homage, Ms. Zhao said, to Pearl Oyster Bar’s seafood. And there’s an intimate semiprivate room.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
