Published late last year, “The Korean Cookbook” by Junghyun Park, the chef at Atomix and others in New York, and Jungyoon Choi, a chef and writer, provides nearly 500 pages of comprehensive illustrated coverage of hansik, or Korean food culture. It surveys history, geography, vocabulary, techniques, ingredients, meal structure and the evolution of Korean food, all for the home cook, starting with fermentation and kimchi, bap (rice) and banchan, the other dishes arrayed on the table to elevate that simple bowl of rice. These include namul (vegetables), wraps, pancakes, broths, stews, dumplings, porridges and sweets. The point is made, repeatedly, that despite the ubiquity of beef in Korean restaurants in the West, notably short ribs, vegetables actually dominate the cuisine. There is a great deal to learn. The 350 recipes do not represent a personal collection but a textbook survey, with some simple treasures like superbly fresh raw fish bibimbap, japchae glass noodles, kimchi fried rice and cucumbers stir-fried with richly marinated beef, all calling for ingredients that are easy to obtain. Others are more challenging, requiring dried jujube, salted shrimp, chrysanthemum leaves and Korean pancake mix. (Possible substitutes are rarely suggested.) And with its focus on regional cooking, the book needs a map for those unfamiliar with Korean geography.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
