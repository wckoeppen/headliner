The donor, on the other hand, saw Biden mostly at the fund-raisers where watching the president’s meandering speeches left him terrified about the upcoming campaign.

Long before that, Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, had gifted the land to his squire Giacometto di Lucia dell’Atella, whose family held onto it for generations and from whom Casa degli Atellani got its name; Leonardo da Vinci spent time there in the late 1490s while painting “The Last Supper” across the street.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

Removing the seafood factor, as in plant-based sushi, is a game changer. Creativity with often commonplace ingredients like carrots, lentils and coconut is required, and there are no rules. A fine example is this new omakase counter in the Sanctuary Hotel near Times Square. The setting is a library, its shelves lined with leather-bound, gilt-embossed volumes and knickknacks; the 10 seats at the polished wood counter are well upholstered with backs. It’s the work of SimpleVenue, the group that is responsible for the modestly priced, high-speed Sushi by Bou. Previously there was an Omakaseed in Plant Bar in NoMad. It closed, replaced by Trust Bae. The Omakaseed has now relocated to the hotel, where it offers an 11 course plant-based tasting for $60 and 15 courses for $100. Ryan Chon and Camdyn Healey are the chefs in charge. The items likely to be served on beautiful little plates, blocks of glass and the like will depend on seaweed “caviar,” charred king oyster mushrooms, tofu with chile crisp, smoked carrot tartare, udon noodles with miso, and shredded hearts of palm.
