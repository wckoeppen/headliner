Emphasizing Bordeaux, Burgundy and Italy, with other major regions, including Spain, the United States and Australia, represented as well, there are pedigreed bottles into the low three figures. But that’s before you step into the soaring circular central core of the store, like a Guggenheim rotunda of wine they’re calling the forum. Even if you’re not in the market for premier cru Burgundies, well-aged first-growth Bordeaux, tête de cuvée Champagnes and sought-after Italian wines priced into the thousands and stacked to the ceiling, it’s worth visiting this section to view it, like an oenophile tourist, as you might a collection of fine art. And they’re all for sale. Originally opened in 2006 by a family-owned company founded in Bordeaux in 1983, and which does most of its business online, it was successful as a neighborhood wine shop. Now, more than double the size, with a world-class inventory, and offering futures (an opportunity to reserve rare wines in advance), the Upper East Side store steps into the gaping carriage trade void left after the venerable Sherry-Lehmann Wine & Spirits sadly plummeted, then failed. As for the spirits side of the alcohol business, they only carry a token selection.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
