While chiming clocks were pioneered in the 1600s, it wasn’t until the late 19th century that the apparatus was perfected in miniature. Squeezing in the more than 100 additional components necessary to have a modern-style wristwatch strike with pinpoint accuracy and rich, clear peals — each watch sounds subtly different — is considered the height of horological craft, and most companies abandoned such complex models long ago. But a few holdouts continue to make such timepieces. Among them is Omega, whose new numbered-edition Speedmaster marries the Swiss brand’s stopwatch chronograph feature with a minute repeater, enabling wearers to press a button that triggers a series of tones to signal the minutes, tens of seconds and seconds. The unique combination, housed in an 18-karat gold case with an aventurine dial and rose guilloche subdials, is arrestingly beautiful while ringing every bell.
