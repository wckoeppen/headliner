Soon, Constantinou was dreaming up a collection of his own. The creative process, says the Tottenham-based 25-year-old, felt surprisingly familiar: “It’s very much about world building; I get the same feeling from composition.” After studying design at London’s Central Saint Martins, he launched his namesake brand in 2022 when the influential retailers Ssense and H. Lorenzo bought pieces from his master’s degree collection. In the short time since, he’s developed a clearly defined style informed by both ancient history (spiral motifs taken from Cypriot ceramics) and futurism (astronaut-style boots), expressed largely through the use of quilted expandable nylon, a high-tech version of the textile that can stretch and contract to a dramatic degree. He’s drawn to the crinkly look of the fabric, and to the fact that it can accommodate a wide variety of body types: Many of his pieces are one size fits all and, while billed as men’s wear, are meant for people of all genders.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
