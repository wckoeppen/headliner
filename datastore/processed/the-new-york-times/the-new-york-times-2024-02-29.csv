Hanging vertically at nine feet, the monumental canvas is part of a new series by Steir — on view at Hauser & Wirth’s West Hollywood gallery — dedicated to the color blue, an exploration that was catalyzed in part by a visit to a “very thorough” ophthalmologist eight years ago, says Steir, 85. “He gave me a color [vision] test and, when he was done, he said, ‘You’re colorblind. You can’t see the color blue,’” she recalls. The diagnosis was not entirely surprising — Steir knew she struggled to discern certain shades from others — but as an artist whose experiments with gesture and color have helped to redefine the canon, the confirmation set her on a new path. She began to scrupulously mix her paints to achieve subtly different hues, then unleashed them on her canvases. “Now I can see many kinds of blue,” she says.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times

Next month, Takaezu’s life and work will be the focus of a major retrospective at the Noguchi Museum in Long Island City, Queens. “Toshiko Takaezu: Worlds Within” will present over 150 pieces from private and public collections around the country, co-curated by the art historian Glenn Adamson, the museum curator Kate Wiener and the composer and sound artist Leilehua Lanzilotti. (A 368-page monograph, published in collaboration with Yale University Press, will accompany the exhibition.) Visitors will be able to see a collection that spans seven decades of Takaezu’s career, from her early student work in Hawaii in the 1940s to immersive, monumental ceramic forms she produced in the late 1990s to early 2000s. “Takaezu was also a weaver and painter, and often constructed multimedia installations where her ceramics, textiles and paintings operated together,” says Wiener. To play off this idea, the curators organized the show chronologically, incorporating each of these media into various sections, inspired by Takaezu’s own installations. Sound will also play a role. In her ceramic pieces, Takaezu would often place a dried fragment of clay within her closed form vessels, creating a musical rattle. For this exhibit, Lanzilotti (a finalist for the 2022 Pulitzer Prize in music) has developed a series of videos offering insight into the sonic elements of Takaezu’s work — and visitors can hear those rattles firsthand via an interactive display.
