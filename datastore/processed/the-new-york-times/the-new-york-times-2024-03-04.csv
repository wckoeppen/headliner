In the past what was often called a rimmed baking sheet and used for the cake that would become a chocolate roulade, the sheet pan, always a restaurant workhorse, is now all you need for a meal. New York Times Cooking lists nearly 1,000 sheet-pan recipes, many of them dinners. As Olga Massov and Sanaë Lemoine demonstrate in their new, cheekily titled cookbook, “Hot Sheet,” you can make just about anything but soup on a sheet pan. They take you through breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert using mainly half-sheets (18 by 13 inches) but also quarter sheets. They discuss materials but, oddly, never mention the issue of warping, which cheaper unreinforced pans are prone to do. The all-in-one recipes like fish over cabbage; chicken with olives, dates and preserved lemon; and also sheet-pan fried rice; roasted carrots; and granola, are the best. Though you can use a sheet pan to roast a whole chicken, duck or rack of lamb, other implements could do the job as well or better, especially when a recipe requires two sheet pans, which seems to miss the point. As for a clafoutis, a pie plate works just fine. Photos of well-used pans with their smudges of dark residue might resonate with home cooks.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
