The director, Myriam Verreault, beautifully mixes joy and tragedy, offering a view of Indigenous life that feels both authentic and bereft of cliché. As both Mikuan’s naïve optimism and Shaniss’s cynicism are tempered over the course of the film, they arrive at a truth somewhere in the middle: that while the world is an unfair and unequal place, they can dream of a different one.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
