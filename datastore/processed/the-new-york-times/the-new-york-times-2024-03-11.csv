Last week, City Hall and the Department of Transportation issued new guidelines for Dining Out NYC, its official program, and the largest such program in the country. “It’s been a priority for Mayor Adams from Day 1,” said Ya-Ting Liu, the city’s chief public realm officer. Restaurants and other establishments that serve food can now apply for permits to take part through an official portal online. Those that are approved and pay a fee for a four-year license ($1,050) for either a roadbed or sidewalk enclosure have 30 days to remove their temporary structures or outfit them to comply with the city’s rules. The authorized structures can remain in place from April through Nov. 29. Restaurants without approval will have to remove their sheds by Aug. 3; those with a pending application will have until Nov. 1. The city has approved four prototypes designed by WXY Studio to eliminate many of the problems with existing makeshift sheds and to adapt to various roadway and sidewalk configurations. They are being built by SITU, a fabrication company, and are already in place at several restaurants. They are not heated and will supposedly be rat-proof; some models are equipped with solar panels. At Bodrum, on Amsterdam Avenue on the Upper West Side, Huseyin Ozer, an owner, said the 40-foot unit in the roadway outside his restaurant had planters, could be customized with signage, will allow for 16 seats and is easy to disassemble. Hinged floor panels lift to allow for cleaning. Full compliance citywide is expected when the season reopens in April 2025.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
