Following his appointment as the official trunk maker for Napoleon III’s wife, Eugénie de Montijo, Vuitton opened his first luggage shop in 1854 near Place Vendôme, where he sold leather travel goods and canvas steamer trunks. Vuitton’s business was strong enough that in 1888, his only son, Georges, trademarked his now-signature checkerboard Damier print.
