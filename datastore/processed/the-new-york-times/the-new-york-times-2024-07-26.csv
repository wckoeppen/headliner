The moniker was more accurate in the 16th century, when it referred to a simple pudding made from clotted cream mixed with sugar and rosewater. But in the Victorian era, the trifle evolved into a more elaborate creation: leftover cake or biscuits piled into a generous, footed glass bowl, saturated with a fortified white wine known as “sack” and sandwiched between fresh fruit, custard, jelly (gelatin made from calves’ feet), syllabub (alcohol-infused whipped cream) and a precursor to modern-day sprinkles made from caraway seeds coated in colored sugar. According to the English food historian Ivan Day, while the exact origins of the confection are unknown, it likely evolved from an amalgamation of several desserts. “On an aristocratic table in 18th-century England you’d have a range of different sweets: biscuits, which they dipped into wineglasses, jellies, custards, syllabub and coated caraway seeds to freshen breath and aid with digestion,” he says. “Trifle became all those dishes mixed together in a bowl.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
