Gargiulo and Remsing talked about how they might work together to bottle the landscape they both know well. Gargiulo’s creative prompt was “a magical liminal world between earth and sky, under the redwoods.” Remsing, Gargiulo says, “took this thing that was pretty esoteric and created something that was a perfect reflection of it.” Understory, a perfume oil with notes of violet, jasmine and moss, was released in 2022. This month, Vintner’s Daughter will debut Understory Vol. 2, which Gargiulo describes as a “new vintage” with subtle differences from its predecessor — the violet notes are stronger while the moss is softer in this iteration. The brand will release a limited run of 500 bottles of perfume oil, this time featuring illustrations by the artist MarSha Yi Robinson. “I love the idea of [Understory] being something that comes and goes, almost like scent itself,” Gargiulo says. $245, vintnersdaughter.com.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
