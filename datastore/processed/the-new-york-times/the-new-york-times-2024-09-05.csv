It was very different then. The gates from the privadas [the three internal lanes where many of the apartments are located] onto the main roads were always open. There was a gang of kids who’d hang out and smoke pot by the fountain and an old man who collected dogs. In 2017, after the earthquake, I lost the apartment I’d been renting in Colonia Roma Sur and this became my home-studio. (These days, I keep my studio elsewhere.) The previous tenant told me my apartment had been a studio for an important actor and singer, Pedro Vargas, and that he’d composed some of his songs here — and perhaps brought his lovers here. I think there’s always been some sort of mix with the world of the arts.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
