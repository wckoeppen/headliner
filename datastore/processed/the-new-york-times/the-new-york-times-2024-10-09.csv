In late 18th-century New England, colonial women would make muster cakes — spiced, doorstop-heavy confections flecked with candied fruit and soaked in alcohol — for soldiers being gathered (or “mustered”) to fight in the Revolutionary War. Later, women baked what became known as election cakes to potentially encourage voters to back causes that they cared about. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, suffragists included several such recipes in the cookbooks that they published — volumes that featured quotes from famous supporters alongside sometimes satirical recipes such as Pie for a Suffragist’s Doubting Husband, the crust of which was to be mixed with “tact and velvet gloves.” For the suffragists, cookbooks were “a tool largely to convince men that they had no plans of leaving the kitchen,” says KC Hysmith, 35, a North Carolina-based recipe developer and culinary historian. “The rhetoric used against them was: If women get the vote, they’re going to leave you to cook your own food.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
