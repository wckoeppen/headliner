For nearly 400 years, it was the seat of the Savoys, the royal family who ruled Italy from 1861 until 1946, when they were deposed by referendum. Their Baroque primary residence, Palazzo Reale, with its Versailles-inspired mirrored halls, still stands as a reminder of the city’s grandeur. In the 1960s, Turin was a center of the Arte Povera movement, which championed art made with commonplace materials, such as Mario Merz’s plastic-bag-and-soil igloos. It was also where the architect Ada Bursi, born in 1906 in Verona, became one of the first women in Italy to practice architecture, designing schools and public housing across the city. “[For her] beauty was not in the value of the materials — it was in how you worked with them,” says Andrea Marcante, 58, who runs the Turinese architecture studio Marcante-Testa with his longtime friend Adelaide Testa, 58. “Bursi believed in democratic luxury.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
