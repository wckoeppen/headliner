Two decades into his film career, he seems restless for new ways to express himself that don’t require a crew of hundreds or any of the baggage that comes with being one of the world’s most famous men. In recent years, he invented the recipe for a bastardized arancini-like dish called piccolini cuscino, or “little pillow” (“I got quite deep into it with a frozen-food manufacturer”); a nine-foot-long sofa with armrests as wide as the seat (“It weighs a ton — that’s probably one of the reasons it’s difficult to sell”); and pants with vertical pockets (“Why do they always have to be sticking out like weird little ears?”). He’s also been designing a straight-back chair with a slit running down the center of the cushion that “opens up for you like you’re in a kind of cocoon,” he says.
