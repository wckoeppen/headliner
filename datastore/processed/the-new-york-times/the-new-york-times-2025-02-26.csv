Asia Grant, 30, a co-founder of the independent fragrance brand Redoux and the host of the Scent Social Club, which offers tours of specialty perfumers in New York City, recommends looking for scents that evoke your favorite emotions and sensations, such as strength or warmth. For an alternative approach, Arabelle Sicardi, 32, a beauty writer and the founder of the event series Perfumed Pages, suggests first identifying the one or two notes you love most and sampling a range of fragrances that feature them. “If you use those notes as your unifying factor,” she says, “you’ll feel more empowered to seek scents that incorporate them in entirely different ways.”",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
