Then I brush my teeth. I’m a Sensodyne girl and use an Oral-B electric toothbrush. I’m a big proponent of brushing your tongue; I’m also a twice-a-day flosser. I don’t use face wash in the morning — I prefer not to wash off all the moisture that I’ve tried to put into my skin the night before. If there’s dry weather, I’ll use a light serum, like Le Sérum from Dior’s Capture line, or 111Skin’s Vitamin C Booster. Other times I’ll just wear my Clé de Peau SPF 50+ sunblock. The color is this soft pink, and it’s incredibly creamy, so it feels like you’re putting on moisturizer. I’m a fan of dry brushing, and I’m a really big lover of a steam. I’ll add some eucalyptus essential oil and do some breathing. I have a giant bottle of the Kiehl’s grapefruit body wash that lasts forever. When I get out of the shower, I do a pretty solid skin routine. I start with the Koh Gen Do Cleansing Spa Water. Then I put on a hydrogel face mask and use the Dior Prestige Le Pétale tool lightly over it — it might be the totally wrong way to do it, but I really like it. I love all the Capture serums, and I’ll alternate between the Retishot and Hyalushot, which I only use once or twice a week because it lasts. And I love the Capture Totale Intensive Restorative Night Creme. I want something that’s got a heavy tone to it when I go to bed because in the morning it feels like I’m just saturated with moisture. I’m not very blonde right now — for this movie, “Apex,” I’m shooting in Australia, I’m quite natural — and am taking care of my hair with Olaplex’s shampoo and conditioner. I also love Virtue’s Damage Reverse Serum and Restorative Treatment Mask.

In 1962, as a student at Cooper Union, he became one of the first artists to settle below Canal Street, at an address on the corner of Lispenard and Church that had once belonged to the abolitionist David Ruggles and been a stop on the Underground Railroad. Frederick Douglass had stayed there for a few days in 1838 after escaping from Maryland in disguise. Whitten occupied the space for 40 years, engaged in an endless exploration of abstract painting that, as he put it near the end of his life, went “beyond the general notions of race, gender, nationalism.” His work influenced generations of artists — from Andy Warhol to Glenn Ligon — but looked like nothing else before or since. He knew everyone who passed through the downtown art scene: Willem de Kooning, Philip Guston, Norman Lewis, Louise Bourgeois, Kate Millett, Bob Thompson, Ishmael Reed, James Baldwin, John Coltrane, Alma Thomas, Jasper Johns, Amiri Baraka, Jean-Michel Basquiat.
