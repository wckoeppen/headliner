Mattila, 40, doesn’t mention the near-perfect symmetry of the building’s two 135-square-foot volumes (one a changing room, the other the sauna), separated by an open void that frames the forest; or the construction’s elegant lock joints, folded like knuckles over the corners of its solid timber walls. Instead, she wants to discuss how the building works: Thin layers of linen packed between logs provide insulation; the stove’s residual heat and air circulation below dry the sauna between uses; gaps around the windows and doorjambs allow the timber to contract over time as it loses moisture. “If you think of a Finnish farmhouse, this is essentially how you build it: a log frame, an oven for baking and, once you’ve lived there for a while, you make another log frame and fill the gap between,” Mattila says. The project’s client, a 54-year-old conductor and violinist named Jan Söderblom, recalls asking the architects for “a combination of timeless and archaic.” So they gave him something virtually indistinguishable from the barns and saunas that Finns have built in their hardscrabble homeland for centuries.",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
