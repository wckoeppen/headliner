In the time since, PB&J has dominated school lunchboxes and shown up in various packaged treats, from Uncrustables to M&M’s. Now pastry chefs like New York’s Miro Uskokovic, 41, are embracing and updating the pairing. At Hani’s, the East Village bakery that he co-owns with his wife, Shilpa, PB&J cake is a perpetual best seller. “With desserts, you should never go too intellectual,” says Uskokovic, who sandwiches wild blueberry compote, peanut butter buttercream and peanut-sesame crunch between layers of yellow sponge. “I haven’t met many people who don’t like PB&J.” At Brio, an Italian restaurant in Amsterdam, the chef Maddy Caldwell, 24, serves a frozen version of the combo, topping her ice cream sundae with peanut sauce and quince jelly, while in Asheville, N.C., Owl Bakery’s Lola Borovyk, 32, simmers local muscadine grapes into jam and then combines them with peanut frangipane and streusel in a twice-baked croissant. “It’s lowbrow meets highbrow,” she says. At Hellbender, a Mexican American restaurant in Ridgewood, Queens, the executive chef Yara Herrera, 33, took inspiration from another childhood favorite: Jell-O. Her parfait features alternating stripes of silky peanut butter and concord grape gelatin with a topping of whipped cream and candied peanuts. Originally conceived of as a special, the dessert was so popular that it’s become a menu mainstay. Says Herrera, “I don’t think PB&J is ever going out of style.” — Tanya Bush",the-new-york-times,The New York Times
