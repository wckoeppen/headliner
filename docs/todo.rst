To Do List
##########

- begin prototyping out some visualizations
   - word clouds?
   - keyword usage over time?
   - location bylines?
   - would be nice to be able to highlight keyword combinations (e.g., coronavirus + hoax) and see the full results
   - author histograms
   - number of articles per time, maybe count binned by day or week.
- handle any errors in responses? (this happened once over the past 3 months, where the NYT json response errored on page 10)
